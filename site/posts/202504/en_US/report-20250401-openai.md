 # What is provisioned throughput?
 
 > [!NOTE]
-> The Azure OpenAI Provisioned offering received significant updates on August 12, 2024, including aligning the purchase model with Azure standards and moving to model-independent quota. It is highly recommended that customers onboarded before this date read the Azure [OpenAI provisioned August update](./provisioned-migration.md) to learn more about these changes.
+> If you're looking for what's recently changed with the provisioned throughput offering, see the [update article](./provisioned-migration.md) for more information.
 
-
-The provisioned throughput capability allows you to specify the amount of throughput you require in a deployment. The service then allocates the necessary model processing capacity and ensures it's ready for you. Throughput is defined in terms of provisioned throughput units (PTU) which is a normalized way of representing the throughput for your deployment. Each model-version pair requires different amounts of PTU to deploy and provide different amounts of throughput per PTU. 
-
-## What do the provisioned deployment types provide?
+The provisioned throughput offering is a model deployment type that allows you to specify the amount of throughput you require in a model deployment. The Azure OpenAI service then allocates the necessary model processing capacity and ensures it's ready for you. Provisioned throughput provides:
 
 - **Predictable performance:** stable max latency and throughput for uniform workloads.
 - **Allocated processing capacity:** A deployment configures the amount of throughput. Once deployed, the throughput is available whether used or not.
 - **Cost savings:** High throughput workloads might provide cost savings vs token-based consumption.
 
-> [!NOTE]
-> Customers can take advantage of additional cost savings on provisioned deployments when they buy [Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service reservations](/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/azure-openai#buy-a-microsoft-azure-openai-service-reservation). 
-
-
-An Azure OpenAI Deployment is a unit of management for a specific OpenAI Model. A deployment provides customer access to a model for inference and integrates more features like Content Moderation ([See content moderation documentation](content-filter.md)). Global provisioned deployments are available in the same Azure OpenAI resources as all other deployment types but allow you to leverage Azure's global infrastructure to dynamically route traffic to the data center with the best availability for each request. Similarly, data zone provisioned deployments are also available in the same resources as all other deployment types but allow you to leverage Azure's global infrastructure to dynamically route traffic to the data center within the Microsoft specified data zone with the best availability for each request.

-## What do you get?
-
-| Topic | Provisioned|
-|---|---|
-| What is it? |Provides guaranteed throughput at smaller increments than the existing provisioned offer. Deployments have a consistent max latency for a given model-version. |
-| Who is it for? | Customers who want guaranteed throughput with minimal latency variance. |
-| Quota |Provisioned Managed Throughput Unit, Global Provisioned Managed Throughput Unit, or Data Zone Provisioned Managed Throughput Unit assigned per region. Quota can be used across any available Azure OpenAI model.|
-| Latency | Max latency constrained from the model. Overall latency is a factor of call shape.  |
-| Utilization | Provisioned-managed Utilization V2 measure provided in Azure Monitor. |
-|Estimating size |Provided sizing calculator in Azure AI Foundry.|
-|Prompt caching | For supported models, we discount up to 100% of cached input tokens. |

+> [!TIP]
+> * You can take advantage of additional cost savings when you buy [Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service reservations](/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/azure-openai#buy-a-microsoft-azure-openai-service-reservation).
+> * Provisioned throughput is available as the following deployment types: [global provisioned](../how-to/deployment-types.md#global-provisioned), [data zone provisioned](../how-to/deployment-types.md#data-zone-provisioned) and [standard provisioned](../how-to/deployment-types.md#provisioned).
 
-## How much throughput per PTU you get for each model
-The amount of throughput (tokens per minute or TPM) a deployment gets per PTU is a function of the input and output tokens in the minute. Generating output tokens requires more processing than input tokens. For the models specified in the table below, 1 output token counts as 3 input tokens towards your TPM per PTU limit. The service dynamically balances the input & output costs, so users do not have to set specific input and output limits. This approach means your deployment is resilient to fluctuations in the workload shape.
+<!--
+Throughput is defined in terms of provisioned throughput units (PTU) which is a normalized way of representing the throughput for your deployment. Each model-version pair requires different amounts of PTU to deploy, and provides different amounts of throughput per PTU. 
 
-To help with simplifying the sizing effort, the following table outlines the TPM per PTU for the specified models. To understand the impact of output tokens on the TPM per PTU limit, use the 3 input token to 1 output token ratio. For a detailed understanding of how different ratios of input and output tokens impact the throughput your workload needs, see the [Azure OpenAI capacity calculator](https://ai.azure.com/resource/calculator). The table also shows Service Level Agreement (SLA) Latency Target Values per model.  For more information about the SLA for Azure OpenAI Service, see the [Service Level Agreements (SLA) for Online Services page](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services?lang=1)

+## When to use provisioned throughput
 
-For a full list see the [Azure OpenAI Service in Azure AI Foundry portal calculator](https://ai.azure.com/resource/calculator).
+You should consider switching from standard deployments to provisioned managed deployments when you have well-defined, predictable throughput and latency requirements. Typically, this occurs when the application is ready for production or has already been deployed in production and there's an understanding of the expected traffic. This allows users to accurately forecast the required capacity and avoid unexpected billing. Provisioned managed deployments are also useful for applications that have real-time/latency sensitive requirements.
 
+## Key concepts
 
-> [!NOTE]
-> Global provisioned and data zone provisioned deployments are only supported for gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini models at this time. For more information on model availability, review the [models documentation](./models.md).
+### Provisioned Throughput Units (PTU)
 
-## Key concepts
+Provisioned throughput units (PTUs) are generic units of model processing capacity that you can use to size provisioned deployments to achieve the required throughput for processing prompts and generating completions. Provisioned throughput units are granted to a subscription as quota, and used to define costs. Each quota is specific to a region and defines the maximum number of PTUs that can be assigned to deployments in that subscription and region. For information about the costs associated with the provision managed offering and PTUs, see [Understanding costs associated with PTU](../how-to/provisioned-throughput-onboarding.md).

-
-PTU quota is available by default in many regions. If more quota is required, customers can request quota via the Request Quota link. This link can be found to the right of the designated provisioned deployment type quota tabs in Azure AI Foundry The form allows the customer to request an increase in the specified PTU quota for a given region. The customer receives an email at the included address once the request is approved, typically within two business days.

 Azure OpenAI is a highly sought-after service where customer demand might exceed service GPU capacity. Microsoft strives to provide capacity for all in-demand regions and models, but selling out a region is always a possibility. This constraint can limit some customers' ability to create a deployment of their desired model, version, or number of PTUs in a desired region - even if they have quota available in that region. Generally speaking:

The API considers both your quota and service capacity in the region.
 
 If an acceptable region isn't available to support the desire model, version and/or PTUs, customers can also try the following steps:
 
 - Attempt the deployment with a smaller number of PTUs.
 - Attempt the deployment at a different time. Capacity availability changes dynamically based on customer demand and more capacity might become available later.
 - Ensure that quota is available in all acceptable regions. The [model capacities API](/rest/api/aiservices/accountmanagement/model-capacities/list?view=rest-aiservices-accountmanagement-2024-04-01-preview&tabs=HTTP&preserve-view=true) and Azure AI Foundry experience consider quota availability in returning alternative regions for creating a deployment.
 
-### Determining the number of PTUs needed for a workload
-
-PTUs represent an amount of model processing capacity. Similar to your computer or databases, different workloads or requests to the model will consume different amounts of underlying processing capacity. The conversion from throughput needs to PTUs can be approximated using historical token usage data or call shape estimations (input tokens, output tokens, and requests per minute) as outlined in our [performance and latency](../how-to/latency.md) documentation. To simplify this process, you can use the [Azure OpenAI Capacity calculator](https://ai.azure.com/resource/calculator) to size specific workload shapes.
+### How can I monitor capacity?
 
-A few high-level considerations:
-- Generations require more capacity than prompts
-- For GPT-4o and later models, the TPM per PTU is set for input and output tokens separately. For older models, larger calls are progressively more expensive to compute. For example, 100 calls of with a 1000 token prompt size requires less capacity than one call with 100,000 tokens in the prompt. This tiering means that the distribution of these call shapes is important in overall throughput. Traffic patterns with a wide distribution that includes some large calls might experience lower throughput per PTU than a narrower distribution with the same average prompt & completion token sizes.
+The [Provisioned-Managed Utilization V2 metric](../how-to/monitoring.md#azure-openai-metrics) in Azure Monitor measures a given deployments utilization on 1-minute increments. All provisioned deployment types are optimized to ensure that accepted calls are processed with a consistent model processing time (actual end-to-end latency is dependent on a call's characteristics).  
 
 ### How utilization performance works
 
 Provisioned deployments provide you with an allocated amount of model processing capacity to run a given model.
 
 In all provisioned deployment types, when capacity is exceeded, the API will return a 429 HTTP Status Error. This fast response enables the user to make decisions on how to manage their traffic. Users can redirect requests to a separate deployment, to a standard pay-as-you-go instance, or use a retry strategy to manage a given request. The service continues to return the 429 HTTP status code until the utilization drops below 100%.

 #### What should  I do when I receive a 429 response?
 The 429 response isn't an error, but instead part of the design for telling users that a given deployment is fully utilized at a point in time. By providing a fast-fail response, you have control over how to handle these situations in a way that best fits your application requirements.

Otherwise, the service estimates the incremental change to utilization required to serve the request by combining the prompt tokens, less any cached tokens, and the specified `max_tokens` in the call. A customer can receive up to a 100% discount on their prompt tokens depending on the size of their cached tokens. If the `max_tokens` parameter is not specified, the service estimates a value.

Otherwise, the service estimates the incremental change to utilization required to serve the request by combining the prompt tokens, less any cached tokens, and the specified `max_tokens` in the call. A customer can receive up to a 100% discount on their prompt tokens depending on the size of their cached tokens. If the `max_tokens` parameter is not specified, the service estimates a value. This estimation can lead to lower concurrency than expected when the number of actual generated tokens is small. For highest concurrency, ensure that the `max_tokens` value is as close as possible to the true generation size.

-This article walks you through the process of onboarding to [Provisioned Throughput Units (PTU)](../concepts/provisioned-throughput.md). Once you complete the initial onboarding, we recommend referring to the PTU [getting started guide](./provisioned-get-started.md).
+Use this article to learn about calculating and understanding costs associated with PTU. For an overview of the provisioned throughput offering, see [What is provisioned throughput?](../concepts/provisioned-throughput.md). When you're ready to sign up for the provisioned throughput offering, see the [getting started guide](./provisioned-get-started.md).
 
-## When to use provisioned throughput units (PTU)
+> [!NOTE]
+> In function calling and agent use cases, token usage can be variable. You should understand your expected Tokens Per Minute (TPM) usage in detail before migrating workloads to PTU.
+
+## Provisioned throughput units
 
-You should consider switching from standard deployments to provisioned deployments when you have well-defined, predictable throughput and latency requirements. Typically, this occurs when the application is ready for production or has already been deployed in production and there's an understanding of the expected traffic. This allows users to accurately forecast the required capacity and avoid unexpected billing. 
+Provisioned throughput units (PTUs) are generic units of model processing capacity that you can use to size provisioned deployments to achieve the required throughput for processing prompts and generating completions.  Provisioned throughput units are granted to a subscription as quota. Each quota is specific to a region and defines  the maximum number of PTUs that can be assigned to deployments in that subscription and region.
 
-### Typical PTU scenarios
+## Understanding provisioned throughput billing
 
-- An application that is ready for production or in production. 
-- An application that has predictable capacity/usage expectations. 
-- An application has real-time/latency sensitive requirements. 
+Azure OpenAI [Provisioned](../how-to/deployment-types.md#provisioned), [Data Zone Provisioned](../how-to/deployment-types.md#data-zone-provisioned) (also known as regional), and [Global Provisioned](../how-to/deployment-types.md#global-provisioned) are purchased on-demand at an hourly basis based on the number of deployed PTUs, with substantial term discount available via the purchase of [Azure Reservations](#azure-reservations-for-azure-openai-provisioned-deployments).  
+
+The hourly model is useful for short-term deployment needs, such as validating new models or acquiring capacity for a hackathon.  However, the discounts provided by the Azure Reservation for Azure OpenAI Provisioned, Data Zone Provisioned, and Global Provisioned are considerable and most customers with consistent long-term usage will find a reserved model to be a better value proposition. 
 
 > [!NOTE]
-> In function calling and agent use cases, token usage can be variable. You should understand your expected Tokens Per Minute (TPM) usage in detail prior to migrating workloads to PTU.
+> Azure OpenAI Provisioned customers onboarded prior to the August self-service update use a purchase model called the Commitment model. These customers can continue to use this older purchase model alongside the Hourly/reservation purchase model. The Commitment model is not available for new customers or [certain new models](../concepts/provisioned-migration.md#supported-models-on-commitment-payment-model) introduced after August 2024. For details on the Commitment purchase model and options for coexistence and migration, see the [Azure OpenAI Provisioned August Update](../concepts/provisioned-migration.md).
 
-## Sizing and estimation: provisioned deployments
 
-Determining the right amount of provisioned throughput, or PTUs, you require for your workload is an essential step to optimizing performance and cost. If you aren't familiar with the different approaches available to estimate system level throughput, review the system level throughput estimation recommendations in our [performance and latency documentation](./latency.md). This section describes how to use Azure OpenAI capacity calculators to estimate the number of PTUs required to support a given workload.
+## Model independent quota
 
-### Estimate provisioned throughput units and cost
+Unlike the Tokens Per Minute (TPM) quota used by other Azure OpenAI offerings, PTUs are model-independent. The PTUs might be used to deploy any supported model/version in the region.
 
-To get a quick estimate for your workload using input and output TPM, leverage the built-in capacity planner in the deployment details section of the deployment dialogue screen. The built-in capacity planner is part of the deployment workflow to help streamline the sizing and allocation of quota to a PTU deployment for a given workload. For more information on how to identify and estimate TPM data, review the recommendations in our [performance and latency documentation](./latency.md).

+> [!NOTE]
+> Global provisioned and data zone provisioned deployments are only supported for gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini models at this time. For more information on model availability, review the [models documentation](../concepts/models.md).
+
+## Hourly usage
+
+Provisioned, Data Zone Provisioned, and Global Provisioned deployments are charged an hourly rate ($/PTU/hr) on the number of PTUs that have been deployed.  For example, a 300 PTU deployment will be charged the hourly rate times 300.  All Azure OpenAI pricing is available in the Azure Pricing Calculator. 
+
+If a deployment exists for a partial hour, it will receive a prorated charge based on the number of minutes it was deployed during the hour.  For example, a deployment that exists for 15 minutes during an hour will receive 1/4th the hourly charge.  
+
+If the deployment size is changed, the costs of the deployment will adjust to match the new number of PTUs.  
+
+:::image type="content" source="../media/provisioned/hourly-billing.png" alt-text="A diagram showing hourly billing." lightbox="../media/provisioned/hourly-billing.png":::
+
+Paying for provisioned, data zoned provisioned, and global provisioned deployments on an hourly basis is ideal for short-term deployment scenarios.  For example: Quality and performance benchmarking of new models, or temporarily increasing PTU capacity to cover an event such as a hackathon.  
+
+Customers that require long-term usage of provisioned, data zoned provisioned, and global provisioned deployments, however, might pay significantly less per month by purchasing a term discount via [Azure Reservations](#azure-reservations-for-azure-openai-provisioned-deployments) as discussed later in the article. 
+
+> [!IMPORTANT]
+> It's not recommended to scale production deployments according to incoming traffic and pay for them purely on an hourly basis. There are two reasons for this:
+> * The cost savings achieved by purchasing Azure Reservations for Azure OpenAI Provisioned, Data Zone Provisioned, and Global Provisioned are significant, and it will be less expensive in many cases to maintain a deployment sized for full production volume paid for via a reservation than it would be to scale the deployment with incoming traffic.
+> * Having unused provisioned quota (PTUs) doesn't guarantee that capacity will be available to support an increase in the size of the deployment when required. Quota limits the maximum number of PTUs that can be deployed, but it isn't a capacity guarantee. Provisioned capacity for each region and model dynamically changes throughout the day and might not be available when required. As a result, it's recommended to maintain a permanent deployment to cover your traffic needs (paid for via a reservation).
+> Charges for deployments on a deleted resource will continue until the resource is purged. To prevent this, delete a resource’s deployment before deleting the resource. For more information, see [Recover or purge deleted Azure AI services resources](../../recover-purge-resources.md). 
+
+## How much throughput per PTU you get for each model
+The amount of throughput (measured in tokens per minute or TPM) a deployment gets per PTU is a function of the input and output tokens in a given minute. 
+
+Generating output tokens requires more processing than input tokens. For the models specified in the table below, 1 output token counts as 3 input tokens towards your TPM-per-PTU limit. The service dynamically balances the input & output costs, so users do not have to set specific input and output limits. This approach means your deployment is resilient to fluctuations in the workload.
+
+To help with simplifying the sizing effort, the following table outlines the TPM-per-PTU for the specified models. To understand the impact of output tokens on the TPM-per-PTU limit, use the 3 input token to 1 output token ratio. 
+
+For a detailed understanding of how different ratios of input and output tokens impact the throughput your workload needs, see the [Azure OpenAI capacity calculator](https://ai.azure.com/resource/calculator). The table also shows Service Level Agreement (SLA) Latency Target Values per model. For more information about the SLA for Azure OpenAI Service, see the [Service Level Agreements (SLA) for Online Services page](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services?lang=1)

-![Screenshot of deployment workflow PTU capacity calculator.](media/provisioned-throughput-onboarding/deployment-ptu-capacity-calculator.png)
+## Determining the number of PTUs needed for a workload
 
+Determining the right amount of provisioned throughput, or PTUs, you require for your workload is an essential step to optimizing performance and cost. 
 
+PTUs represent an amount of model processing capacity. Similar to your computer or databases, different workloads or requests to the model will consume different amounts of underlying processing capacity. The conversion from throughput needs to PTUs can be approximated using historical token usage data or call shape estimations (input tokens, output tokens, and requests per minute) as outlined in our [performance and latency](../how-to/latency.md) documentation. To simplify this process, you can use the [Azure OpenAI Capacity calculator](https://ai.azure.com/resource/calculator) to size specific workload shapes.
 
+A few high-level considerations:
+- Generations require more capacity than prompts
+- For GPT-4o and later models, the TPM per PTU is set for input and output tokens separately. For older models, larger calls are progressively more expensive to compute. For example, 100 calls of with a 1000 token prompt size requires less capacity than one call with 100,000 tokens in the prompt. This tiering means that the distribution of these call shapes is important in overall throughput. Traffic patterns with a wide distribution that includes some large calls might experience lower throughput per PTU than a narrower distribution with the same average prompt & completion token sizes.
+
+### Obtaining PTU quota
+
+PTU quota is available by default in many regions. If more quota is required, customers can request quota via the Request Quota link. This link can be found to the right of the designated provisioned deployment type quota tabs in Azure AI Foundry The form allows the customer to request an increase in the specified PTU quota for a given region. The customer receives an email at the included address once the request is approved, typically within two business days. 
+
+### Per-Model PTU minimums
+
+The minimum PTU deployment, increments, and processing capacity associated with each unit varies by model type & version. See the above [table](#how-much-throughput-per-ptu-you-get-for-each-model) for more information.
+
+## Estimate provisioned throughput units and cost
+
+To get a quick estimate for your workload using input and output TPM, leverage the built-in capacity planner in the deployment details section of the deployment dialogue screen. The built-in capacity planner is part of the deployment workflow to help streamline the sizing and allocation of quota to a PTU deployment for a given workload. For more information on how to identify and estimate TPM data, review the recommendations in our [performance and latency documentation](./latency.md). 
+
+To use the capacity planner, go to the Azure AI Foundry Portal and select the **Deployments** button. Then select **Deploy model**.

-## Understanding the provisioned throughput purchase model
-
-Azure OpenAI Provisioned, Data Zone Provisioned, and Global Provisioned are purchased on-demand at an hourly basis based on the number of deployed PTUs, with substantial term discount available via the purchase of Azure Reservations.   
-
-The hourly model is useful for short-term deployment needs, such as validating new models or acquiring capacity for a hackathon.  However, the discounts provided by the Azure Reservation for Azure OpenAI Provisioned, Data Zone Provisioned, and Global Provisioned are considerable and most customers with consistent long-term usage will find a reserved model to be a better value proposition. 
-
-> [!NOTE]
-> Azure OpenAI Provisioned customers onboarded prior to the August self-service update use a purchase model called the Commitment model.  These customers can continue to use this older purchase model alongside the Hourly/reservation purchase model.  The Commitment model is not available for new customers or new models introduced after August 2024.  For details on the Commitment purchase model and options for coexistence and migration, please see the [Azure OpenAI Provisioned August Update](../concepts/provisioned-migration.md).
-## Hourly usage
-
-Provisioned, Data Zone Provisioned, and Global Provisioned deployments are charged an hourly rate ($/PTU/hr) on the number of PTUs that have been deployed.  For example, a 300 PTU deployment will be charged the hourly rate times 300.  All Azure OpenAI pricing is available in the Azure Pricing Calculator. 
-
-If a deployment exists for a partial hour, it will receive a prorated charge based on the number of minutes it was deployed during the hour.  For example, a deployment that exists for 15 minutes during an hour will receive 1/4th the hourly charge.  
-
-If the deployment size is changed, the costs of the deployment will adjust to match the new number of PTUs.   
-
-:::image type="content" source="../media/provisioned/hourly-billing.png" alt-text="A diagram showing hourly billing." lightbox="../media/provisioned/hourly-billing.png":::
-
-Paying for provisioned, data zoned provisioned, and global provisioned deployments on an hourly basis is ideal for short-term deployment scenarios.  For example: Quality and performance benchmarking of new models, or temporarily increasing PTU capacity to cover an event such as a hackathon.  
-
-Customers that require long-term usage of provisioned, data zoned provisioned, and global provisioned deployments, however, might pay significantly less per month by purchasing a term discount via Azure Reservations as discussed in the next section. 
-
-> [!NOTE]
-> It is not recommended to scale production deployments according to incoming traffic and pay for them purely on an hourly basis. There are two reasons for this:
-> * The cost savings achieved by purchasing Azure Reservations for Azure OpenAI Provisioned, Data Zone Provisioned, and Global Provisioned are significant, and it will be less expensive in many cases to maintain a deployment sized for full production volume paid for via a reservation than it would be to scale the deployment with incoming traffic.
-> * Having unused provisioned quota (PTUs) does not guarantee that capacity will be available to support an increase in the size of the deployment when required. Quota limits the maximum number of PTUs that can be deployed, but it is not a capacity guarantee. Provisioned capacity for each region and model dynamically changes throughout the day and might not be available when required. As a result, it is recommended to maintain a permanent deployment to cover your traffic needs (paid for via a reservation).
-> * Charges for deployments on a deleted resource will continue until the resource is purged.  To prevent this, delete a resource’s deployment before deleting the resource.  For more information, see [Recover or purge deleted Azure AI services resources](../../recover-purge-resources.md).

 ## Azure Reservations for Azure OpenAI provisioned deployments
 
 Discounts on top of the hourly usage price can be obtained by purchasing an Azure Reservation for Azure OpenAI Provisioned, Data Zone Provisioned, and Global Provisioned. An Azure Reservation is a term-discounting mechanism shared by many Azure products. For example, Compute and Cosmos DB. For Azure OpenAI Provisioned, Data Zone Provisioned, and Global Provisioned, the reservation provides a discount in exchange for committing to payment for fixed number of PTUs for a one-month or one-year period.

    "modification_title": "Revise and expand content in provisioned-throughput-onboarding.md"
}
```

### Explanation
The `provisioned-throughput-onboarding.md` file has undergone a major update, significantly revising the content to enhance clarity and comprehensiveness about costs associated with Provisioned Throughput Units (PTUs) for the Azure OpenAI Service. 

The title was changed to "Understanding costs associated with provisioned throughput units (PTU)" to better reflect the revised focus of the document. The introductory section has been restructured to guide users in understanding PTU costs better, with new sections added to explain billing, model-independent quotas, and how to estimate the number of PTUs needed based on various models.

Several new concepts have been introduced:
- A detailed explanation of how to calculate PTU costs based on usage and the hourly billing structure.
- The potential benefits of Azure Reservations for cost savings over standard hourly billing.
- Clear instructions on obtaining PTU quotas and how to properly size reservations based on actual deployments to prevent over-purchasing.

Additionally, there are numerous enhancements, such as detailed tables and illustrations that provide clarity on throughput per PTU per model, and best practices for managing Azure Reservations effectively. This extensive modification aims to provide users with a thorough understanding of cost implications and practical guidance for provisioning their Azure OpenAI deployments effectively.

 ### In-place migrations for provisioned deployments
 In-place migrations allow you to maintain the same provisioned deployment name and size while changing the model version or model family assigned to that deployment. With in-place migrations, Azure OpenAI Service takes care of migrating any existing traffic between model versions or model families throughout the migration over a 20-30 minute window. Throughout the migration window, your provisioned deployment will display an "updating" provisioned state. You can continue to use your provisioned deployment as you normally would. Once the in-place migration is complete, the provisioned state will be updated to "succeeded", indicating that all traffic has been migrated over to the target model version or model family.
