 # Extract text and information from images by using AI enrichment
 
-Through [AI enrichment](cognitive-search-concept-intro.md), Azure AI Search gives you several options for creating and extracting searchable text from images, including:
+Images often contain useful information that's relevant in search scenarios. You can [vectorize images](search-get-started-portal-image-search.md) to represent visual content in your search index. Or, you can use [AI enrichment and skillsets](cognitive-search-concept-intro.md) to create and extract searchable *text* from images, including:
 
 + [OCR](cognitive-search-skill-ocr.md) for optical character recognition of text and digits
 + [Image Analysis](cognitive-search-skill-image-analysis.md) that describes images through visual features
 + [Custom skills](#passing-images-to-custom-skills) to invoke any external image processing that you want to provide
 
 By using OCR, you can extract text and from photos or pictures, such as the word *STOP* in a stop sign. Through image analysis, you can generate a text representation of an image, such as *dandelion* for a photo of a dandelion, or the color *yellow*. You can also extract metadata about the image, such as its size.
 
-This article covers the fundamentals of working with images, and also describes several common scenarios, such as working with embedded images, custom skills, and overlaying visualizations on original images.

+This article explains how to create and manage search objects using C# and the [**Azure.Search.Documents**](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/search) client library in the Azure SDK for .NET.
 
-## About version 11
-
-Azure SDK for .NET includes an [**Azure.Search.Documents**](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/search) client library from the Azure SDK team that is functionally equivalent to the previous client library, [Microsoft.Azure.Search](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.search). Version 11 is more consistent in terms of Azure programmability. Some examples include [`AzureKeyCredential`](/dotnet/api/azure.azurekeycredential) key authentication, and [System.Text.Json.Serialization](/dotnet/api/system.text.json.serialization) for JSON serialization.

-
-The client library doesn't provide [service management operations](/rest/api/searchmanagement/), such as creating and scaling search services and managing API keys. If you need to manage your search resources from a .NET application, use the [Microsoft.Azure.Management.Search](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.management.search) library in the Azure SDK for .NET.
-
-## Upgrade to v11
-
-If you've been using the previous version of the .NET SDK and you'd like to upgrade to the current generally available version, see [Upgrade to Azure AI Search .NET SDK version 11](search-dotnet-sdk-migration-version-11.md).
+The **Azure.Search.Documents** client library doesn't provide [service management operations](/rest/api/searchmanagement/), such as creating and scaling search services and managing API keys.
