+# How to use the GPT-4o Realtime API via WebRTC (Preview)
+
+[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](../includes/preview-feature.md)]
+
+Azure OpenAI GPT-4o Realtime API for speech and audio is part of the GPT-4o model family that supports low-latency, "speech in, speech out" conversational interactions. 
+
+You can use the Realtime API via WebRTC or WebSocket to send audio input to the model and receive audio responses in real time. Follow the instructions in this article to get started with the Realtime API via WebRTC.
+
+In most cases, we recommend using the WebRTC API for real-time audio streaming. The WebRTC API is a web standard that enables real-time communication (RTC) between browsers and mobile applications. Here are some reasons why WebRTC is preferred for real-time audio streaming:
+- **Lower Latency**: WebRTC is designed to minimize delay, making it more suitable for audio and video communication where low latency is critical for maintaining quality and synchronization.
+- **Media Handling**: WebRTC has built-in support for audio and video codecs, providing optimized handling of media streams.
+- **Error Correction**: WebRTC includes mechanisms for handling packet loss and jitter, which are essential for maintaining the quality of audio streams over unpredictable networks.
+- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: WebRTC allows direct communication between clients, reducing the need for a central server to relay audio data, which can further reduce latency.
+
+Use the [Realtime API via WebSockets](./realtime-audio-websockets.md) if you need to stream audio data from a server to a client, or if you need to send and receive data in real time between a client and server. WebSockets aren't recommended for real-time audio streaming because they have higher latency than WebRTC.
+
+## Supported models
+
+The GPT 4o real-time models are available for global deployments in [East US 2 and Sweden Central regions](../concepts/models.md#global-standard-model-availability).
+- `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` (2024-12-17)
+- `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` (2024-12-17)
+
+You should use API version `2025-04-01-preview` in the URL for the Realtime API. The API version is included in the sessions URL.
+
+For more information about supported models, see the [models and versions documentation](../concepts/models.md#audio-models).
+
+## Prerequisites
+
+Before you can use GPT-4o real-time audio, you need:
+
+- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
+- An Azure OpenAI resource created in a [supported region](#supported-models). For more information, see [Create a resource and deploy a model with Azure OpenAI](create-resource.md).
+- You need a deployment of the `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` or `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` model in a supported region as described in the [supported models](#supported-models) section. You can deploy the model from the [Azure AI Foundry model catalog](../../../ai-foundry/how-to/model-catalog-overview.md) or from your project in Azure AI Foundry portal. 
+
+## Connection and authentication
+
+You use different URLs to get an ephemeral API key and connect to the Realtime API via WebRTC. The URLs are constructed as follows:
+
+| URL | Description | 
+|---|---|
+| Sessions URL | The `/realtime/sessions` URL is used to get an ephemeral API key. The sessions URL includes the Azure OpenAI resource URL, deployment name, the `/realtime/sessions` path, and the API version.<br/><br/>You should use API version `2025-04-01-preview` in the URL.<br/><br/>For an example and more information, see the [Sessions URL](#sessions-url) section below.|
+| WebRTC URL | The WebRTC URL is used to establish a WebRTC peer connection with the Realtime API. The WebRTC URL includes the region and the `realtimeapi-preview.ai.azure.com/v1/realtimertc` path.<br/><br/>The supported regions are `eastus2` and `swedencentral`.<br/><br/>For an example and more information, see the [Sessions URL](#webrtc-url) section below.|
+
+### Sessions URL
+Here's an example of a well-constructed `realtime/sessions` URL that you use to get an ephemeral API key:
+
+```http
+https://YourAzureOpenAIResourceName.openai.azure.com/openai/realtimeapi/sessions?api-version=2025-04-01-preview
+```
+### WebRTC URL
+Make sure the region of the WebRTC URL matches the region of your Azure OpenAI resource.
+
+For example:
+- If your Azure OpenAI resource is in the swedencentral region,
+the WebRTC URL should be:
+    ```http
+    https://swedencentral.realtimeapi-preview.ai.azure.com/v1/realtimertc
+    ```
+- If your Azure OpenAI resource is in the eastus2 region, the WebRTC URL should be:
+    ```http
+    https://eastus2.realtimeapi-preview.ai.azure.com/v1/realtimertc
+    ```
+
+The sessions URL includes the Azure OpenAI resource URL, deployment name, the `/realtime/sessions` path, and the API version. The Azure OpenAI resource region isn't part of the sessions URL.
+
+### Ephemeral API key
+
+You can use the ephemeral API key to authenticate a WebRTC session with the Realtime API. The ephemeral key is valid for one minute and is used to establish a secure WebRTC connection between the client and the Realtime API.
+
+Here's how the ephemeral API key is used in the Realtime API:
+
+1. Your client requests an ephemeral API key from your server.
+1. Your server mints the ephemeral API key using the standard API key. 
+    
+    > [!WARNING]
+    > Never use the standard API key in a client application. The standard API key should only be used in a secure backend service.
+
+1. Your server returns the ephemeral API key to your client.
+1. Your client uses the ephemeral API key to authenticate a session with the Realtime API via WebRTC.
+1. You send and receive audio data in real time using the WebRTC peer connection.
+
+The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of minting an ephemeral API key and using it to authenticate a WebRTC session with the Realtime API. 
+
+:::image type="content" source="../media/how-to/real-time/ephemeral-key-webrtc.png" alt-text="Diagram of the ephemeral API key to WebRTC peer connection sequence." lightbox="../media/how-to/real-time/ephemeral-key-webrtc.png":::

+
+## WebRTC example via HTML and JavaScript
+
+The following code sample demonstrates how to use the GPT-4o Realtime API via WebRTC. The sample uses the [WebRTC API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) to establish a real-time audio connection with the model.
+
+The sample code is an HTML page that allows you to start a session with the GPT-4o Realtime API and send audio input to the model. The model's responses are played back in real-time.
+
+> [!WARNING]
+> The sample code includes the API key hardcoded in the JavaScript. This code isn't recommended for production use. In a production environment, you should use a secure backend service to generate an ephemeral key and return it to the client.
+
+1. Copy the following code into an HTML file and open it in a web browser:
+
+    ```html
+    <!DOCTYPE html>
+    <html lang="en">
+    <head>
+        <meta charset="UTF-8">
+        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
+        <title>Azure OpenAI Realtime Session</title>
+    </head>
+    <body>
+        <h1>Azure OpenAI Realtime Session</h1>
+        <p>WARNING: Don't use this code sample in production with the API key hardcoded. Use a protected backend service to call the sessions API and generate the ephemeral key. Then return the ephemeral key to the client.</p>

+# How to use the GPT-4o Realtime API via WebSockets (Preview)
+
+[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](../includes/preview-feature.md)]
+
+Azure OpenAI GPT-4o Realtime API for speech and audio is part of the GPT-4o model family that supports low-latency, "speech in, speech out" conversational interactions. 
+
+You can use the Realtime API via WebRTC or WebSocket to send audio input to the model and receive audio responses in real time. Follow the instructions in this article to get started with the Realtime API via WebSockets.
+
+Use the Realtime API via WebSockets in server-to-server scenarios where low latency isn't a requirement.
+
+> [!TIP] 
+> In most cases, we recommend using the [Realtime API via WebRTC](./realtime-audio-webrtc.md) for real-time audio streaming in client-side applications such as a web application or mobile app. WebRTC is designed for low-latency, real-time audio streaming and is the best choice for most use cases.
+
+## Supported models
+
+The GPT-4o real-time models are available for global deployments in [East US 2 and Sweden Central regions](../concepts/models.md#global-standard-model-availability).
+- `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` (2024-12-17)
+- `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` (2024-12-17)
+
+You should use API version `2025-04-01-preview` in the URL for the Realtime API. 
+
+For more information about supported models, see the [models and versions documentation](../concepts/models.md#audio-models).
+
+## Prerequisites
+
+Before you can use GPT-4o real-time audio, you need:
+
+- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
+- An Azure OpenAI resource created in a [supported region](#supported-models). For more information, see [Create a resource and deploy a model with Azure OpenAI](create-resource.md).
+- You need a deployment of the `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` or `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` model in a supported region as described in the [supported models](#supported-models) section. You can deploy the model from the [Azure AI Foundry portal model catalog](../../../ai-foundry/how-to/model-catalog-overview.md) or from your project in Azure AI Foundry portal. 
+
+## Connection and authentication
+
+The Realtime API (via `/realtime`) is built on [the WebSockets API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) to facilitate fully asynchronous streaming communication between the end user and model. 
+
+The Realtime API is accessed via a secure WebSocket connection to the `/realtime` endpoint of your Azure OpenAI resource.
+
+You can construct a full request URI by concatenating:
+
+- The secure WebSocket (`wss://`) protocol.
+- Your Azure OpenAI resource endpoint hostname, for example, `my-aoai-resource.openai.azure.com`
+- The `openai/realtime` API path.
+- An `api-version` query string parameter for a supported API version such as `2024-12-17`
+- A `deployment` query string parameter with the name of your `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` or `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` model deployment.
+
+The following example is a well-constructed `/realtime` request URI:
+
+```http
+wss://my-eastus2-openai-resource.openai.azure.com/openai/realtime?api-version=2024-12-17&deployment=gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview-deployment-name
+```
+
+To authenticate:
+- **Microsoft Entra** (recommended): Use token-based authentication with the `/realtime` API for an Azure OpenAI resource with managed identity enabled. Apply a retrieved authentication token using a `Bearer` token with the `Authorization` header.
+- **API key**: An `api-key` can be provided in one of two ways:
+  - Using an `api-key` connection header on the prehandshake connection. This option isn't available in a browser environment.
+  - Using an `api-key` query string parameter on the request URI. Query string parameters are encrypted when using https/wss.
+
+## Realtime API via WebSockets architecture
+
+Once the WebSocket connection session to `/realtime` is established and authenticated, the functional interaction takes place via events for sending and receiving WebSocket messages. These events each take the form of a JSON object. 
+
+:::image type="content" source="../media/how-to/real-time/realtime-api-sequence.png" alt-text="Diagram of the Realtime API authentication and connection sequence." lightbox="../media/how-to/real-time/realtime-api-sequence.png":::

+  AOAI--)MiddleTier: (within responses) create/start/add/finish items
+  AOAI--)MiddleTier: (within items) create/stream/finish content parts
+-->
+
+Events can be sent and received in parallel and applications should generally handle them both concurrently and asynchronously.
+
+- A client-side caller establishes a connection to `/realtime`, which starts a new [`session`](../realtime-audio-reference.md#realtimerequestsession).
+- A `session` automatically creates a default `conversation`. Multiple concurrent conversations aren't supported.
+- The `conversation` accumulates input signals until a `response` is started, either via a direct event by the caller or automatically by voice activity detection (VAD).
+- Each `response` consists of one or more `items`, which can encapsulate messages, function calls, and other information.
+- Each message `item` has `content_part`, allowing multiple modalities (text and audio) to be represented across a single item.
+- The `session` manages configuration of caller input handling (for example, user audio) and common output generation handling.
+- Each caller-initiated [`response.create`](../realtime-audio-reference.md#realtimeclienteventresponsecreate) can override some of the output [`response`](../realtime-audio-reference.md#realtimeresponse) behavior, if desired.
+- Server-created `item` and the `content_part` in messages can be populated asynchronously and in parallel. For example, receiving audio, text, and function information concurrently in a round robin fashion.
+

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Clarifications on response formats for DALL-E 3 in API documentation. Locale: en_US"
}
```

### Explanation
The recent modifications made to the `latest-inference-preview.md` file focus on clarifying the response formats for images generated by the DALL-E 3 model and the GPT-image-1 model. The changes involve both adding and removing lines, resulting in clearer documentation.

The primary update specifies that the `response_format` parameter for DALL-E 3 generated images can now return images either as `url` or `b64_json`. In contrast, the GPT-image-1 model will only return images in a base64-encoded format. This differentiation helps users understand the output they can expect based on the model they are utilizing.

Additionally, the descriptions associated with the `response_format` have been improved to explicitly indicate the supported formats for DALL-E 3 and to mention the limitation for the GPT-image-1 model. The updates also remove redundant or outdated information to streamline the documentation and enhance its usability for developers integrating these AI image generation capabilities into their applications. Overall, these changes aim to make the API documentation clearer and more informative, ensuring that users have accurate expectations regarding image generation output.

-## Connection
-
-The Realtime API requires an existing Azure OpenAI resource endpoint in a supported region. The API is accessed via a secure WebSocket connection to the `/realtime` endpoint of your Azure OpenAI resource.
-
-You can construct a full request URI by concatenating:
-
-- The secure WebSocket (`wss://`) protocol.
-- Your Azure OpenAI resource endpoint hostname, for example, `my-aoai-resource.openai.azure.com`
-- The `openai/realtime` API path.
-- An `api-version` query string parameter for a supported API version such as `2024-10-01-preview`.
-- A `deployment` query string parameter with the name of your `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` or `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` model deployment.
-
-The following example is a well-constructed `/realtime` request URI:
-
-```http
-wss://my-eastus2-openai-resource.openai.azure.com/openai/realtime?api-version=2024-10-01-preview&deployment=gpt-4o-realtime-preview
-```
-
-## Authentication
-
-To authenticate:
-- **Microsoft Entra** (recommended): Use token-based authentication with the `/realtime` API for an Azure OpenAI Service resource with managed identity enabled. Apply a retrieved authentication token using a `Bearer` token with the `Authorization` header.
-- **API key**: An `api-key` can be provided in one of two ways:
-  - Using an `api-key` connection header on the prehandshake connection. This option isn't available in a browser environment.
-  - Using an `api-key` query string parameter on the request URI. Query string parameters are encrypted when using https/wss.
-
 ## Client events
 
 There are nine client events that can be sent from the client to the server:
