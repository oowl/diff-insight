# Insights

The modifications in the Azure AI documentation aim to improve user experience by ensuring accuracy, ease of navigation, and clarity, which are critical attributes for technical documentation related to AI technologies. The updates focus on several key areas:

Firstly, the support details for Document Intelligence containers have been updated, paving the way for the new version v4.0, which is set to launch in late 2024. This preparation is crucial for users needing to adapt to or leverage new features in the upcoming release, offering them the ability to plan and integrate enhancements into their systems.

Moreover, spelling and typographic errors have been corrected throughout the documentation. Even minor inaccuracies, such as incorrect spellings, can lead to confusion or misinterpretation of the guidance, so amending these issues significantly contributes to the document's professionalism and credibility. Keeping the documentation precise ensures users can efficiently implement and utilize the AI services without unnecessary hindrances.

Additionally, many links have been updated to redirect users to the correct "Azure AI Foundry" documentation pages. This adjustment is not just about correcting mistyped URLs; it's about ensuring that users have a seamless and efficient pathway to resources. It plays a critical role in enhancing the documentation's value by providing easy access to relevant and crucial information, minimizing frustration, and potentially speeding up users' learning and implementation processes.

Overall, these meticulous quality improvements, though seemingly minor, reflect a commitment to maintaining high standards in technical documentation, ultimately facilitating a smoother and more effective experience for users engaging with Azure's AI services. This proactive approach to documentation ensures that users are well-supported and can focus on leveraging the technology itself rather than figuring out how to access and implement it correctly.

 Azure AI Document Intelligence is an Azure AI service that lets you build automated data processing software using machine-learning technology. Document Intelligence enables you to identify and extract text, key/value pairs, selection marks, table data, and more from your documents. The results are delivered as structured data that ../includes the relationships in the original file. Containers process only the data provided to them and solely utilize the resources they're permitted to access. Containers can't process data from other regions.
 
 In this article you can learn how to download, install, and run Document Intelligence containers. Containers enable you to run the Document Intelligence service in your own environment. Containers are great for specific security and data governance requirements.
