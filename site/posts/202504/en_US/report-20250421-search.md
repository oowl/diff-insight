summary: This modification provides a minor update to the C# search query integration
  tutorial by correcting file extensions from `.js` to `.jsx` in the documentation.
  This change enhances clarity and consistency, particularly in sections related to
  the React client and Suggest function API. Although there are no new features or
  breaking changes, the update ensures that developers have a clear understanding
  of file types used in React applications. By using the `.jsx` extension, which indicates
  the use of JSX syntax in JavaScript, the modification improves usability and accuracy
  in the tutorial, aiding developers in integrating search queries with React components
  effectively.

# Highlights
This modification involves a minor update to the C# search query integration tutorial. Specifically, it updates the file extensions in the documentation for accuracy and consistency by changing them from `.js` to `.jsx`.

## New features
- None.

## Breaking changes
- None.

## Other updates
- File extensions in sections related to the React client and Suggest function API have been updated from `.js` to `.jsx` for consistency and clarity.

# Insights
The change in the tutorial documentation pertains to correcting file extensions from `.js` to `.jsx`. This adjustment, although minor, plays a crucial role in ensuring that developers following the tutorial have a clear understanding of which file types are being referred to, especially within the context of React applications. 

The JSX file extension is typically used in React when JavaScript is used with JSX syntaxâ€”a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows HTML-like code in JavaScript files. Using the `.jsx` extension highlights the usage of this specific syntax, distinguishing it from conventional JavaScript files. Given that React applications commonly involve JSX to define components, labeling the files correctly ensures that users can follow the tutorial accurately and avoid potential confusion.

Ultimately, this update improves the documentation's usability by ensuring consistency and enhancing accuracy, helping developers locate and implement the relevant code more effectively when integrating search queries in C# applications with React components.
