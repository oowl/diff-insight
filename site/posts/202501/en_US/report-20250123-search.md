# Insights

This diff demonstrates an approach to refining technical documentation for better user guidance and alignment with branding standards. 

In the MySQL indexing guide, the capital alteration of "Flexible Server" across various sections exemplifies the importance of uniform branding in technical documents. Proper noun capitalization is not just a formality but contributes to the recognition and professionalism of a brand. This adjustment underlines the necessity of adhering to accepted naming conventions to avoid ambiguity.

For region support documentation, the removal of "All Tiers" in the context of Virginia may appear inconsequential but might signify an underlying business or operational decision about service tier availability. This change, while subtle, alerts users to verify tier-specific support details, potentially prompting them to check for any new or unpublished modifications in service offerings.

The tutorial on C# search query integration places emphasis on user experience by expanding explanations around the Search API and its interaction with the Suggest API. By consolidating sections and adding context about the search suggester, the tutorial not only becomes more cohesive but further educates users about performing efficient search operations. This reflects a shift towards more holistic guides, wherein understanding system behavior and foundational concepts plays a pivotal role in practical implementation.

Overall, these updates illustrate detailed finesse in documentation aiming to not only inform but enrich user interaction with Azure services. By maintaining precision in terminology, providing streamlined regional data, and enriching technical tutorials, Azure ensures that documentation remains a reliable foundation for users navigating their offerings.

 > MySQL support is currently in public preview under [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). You can use 2020-06-30-preview or later to index your content. We recommend the latest preview API. There is currently no portal support.
 
 In this article, learn how to configure an [**indexer**](search-indexer-overview.md) that imports content from Azure Database for MySQL and makes it searchable in Azure AI Search. Inputs to the indexer are your row, in a single table or view. Output is a search index with searchable content in individual fields.
 
-This article supplements [**Create an indexer**](search-howto-create-indexers.md) with information that's specific to indexing from Azure Database for MySQL flexible server. It uses the REST APIs to demonstrate a three-part workflow common to all indexers: create a data source, create an index, create an indexer. Data extraction occurs when you submit the Create Indexer request.
