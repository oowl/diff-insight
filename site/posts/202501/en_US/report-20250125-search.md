# Highlights
The main highlight of this modification is the correction of a typographical error in the naming of the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK. This change is a minor update aimed at maintaining consistency and correctness in the documentation.

## New features
- No new features were introduced in this modification.

## Breaking changes
- There are no breaking changes resulting from this update.

## Other updates
- A typographical error was corrected by changing "JavaScript/Typescript" to "JavaScript/TypeScript" to properly reflect the appropriate naming convention.

# Insights
The update made to the file `search-get-started-text.md` reflects an attention to detail in documentation, which plays a crucial role in user understanding and adoption of the SDKs. Consistency in the use of terms, especially technical nomenclature, ensures users have clear, professional, and reliable resources. The correction, while minor, illustrates the documentation team's effort to align closely with standard naming conventions, which is particularly important in technical writing. By changing the lowercase 't' to an uppercase 'T' in "TypeScript," the document not only adheres to the correct branding but also avoids potential confusion among users who expect the official language name. This seemingly small change is part of broader good practices in technical writing to prevent discrepancies across documentation that could lead to misunderstandings or mistrust from the developer community.
