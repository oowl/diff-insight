+# How to use DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model
+
+[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/ai-studio/includes/feature-preview.md)]
+
+In this article, you learn about DeepSeek-R1 and how to use them.
+DeepSeek-R1 excels at reasoning tasks using a step-by-step training process, such as language, scientific reasoning, and coding tasks. It features 671B total parameters with 37B active parameters, and 128k context length.
+
+
+
+::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
+
+## DeepSeek-R1
+
+DeepSeek-R1 builds on the progress of earlier reasoning-focused models that improved performance by extending Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. DeepSeek-R1 takes things further by combining reinforcement learning (RL) with fine-tuning on carefully chosen datasets. It evolved from an earlier version, DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which relied solely on RL and showed strong reasoning skills but had issues like hard-to-read outputs and language inconsistencies. To address these limitations, DeepSeek-R1 incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and follows a refined training pipeline that blends reasoning-oriented RL with supervised fine-tuning on curated datasets, resulting in a model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning benchmarks.
+
+
+You can learn more about the models in their respective model card:
+
+* [DeepSeek-R1](https://aka.ms/azureai/landing/DeepSeek-R1)
+
+
+## Prerequisites
+
+To use DeepSeek-R1 with Azure AI Foundry, you need the following prerequisites:
+
+### A model deployment
+
+**Deployment to serverless APIs**
+
+DeepSeek-R1 can be deployed to serverless API endpoints with pay-as-you-go billing. This kind of deployment provides a way to consume models as an API without hosting them on your subscription, while keeping the enterprise security and compliance that organizations need. 
+
+Deployment to a serverless API endpoint doesn't require quota from your subscription. If your model isn't deployed already, use the Azure AI Studio, Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python, the Azure CLI, or ARM templates to [deploy the model as a serverless API](deploy-models-serverless.md).
+
+> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
+> [Deploy the model to serverless API endpoints](deploy-models-serverless.md)
+
+### The inference package installed
+
+You can consume predictions from this model by using the `azure-ai-inference` package with Python. To install this package, you need the following prerequisites:
+
+* Python 3.8 or later installed, including pip.
+* The endpoint URL. To construct the client library, you need to pass in the endpoint URL. The endpoint URL has the form `https://your-host-name.your-azure-region.inference.ai.azure.com`, where `your-host-name` is your unique model deployment host name and `your-azure-region` is the Azure region where the model is deployed (for example, eastus2).
+* Depending on your model deployment and authentication preference, you need either a key to authenticate against the service, or Microsoft Entra ID credentials. The key is a 32-character string.
+  
+Once you have these prerequisites, install the Azure AI inference package with the following command:
+
+```bash
+pip install azure-ai-inference
+```
+
+Read more about the [Azure AI inference package and reference](https://aka.ms/azsdk/azure-ai-inference/python/reference).
+
+## Work with chat completions
+
+In this section, you use the [Azure AI model inference API](https://aka.ms/azureai/modelinference) with a chat completions model for chat.
+
+> [!TIP]
+> The [Azure AI model inference API](https://aka.ms/azureai/modelinference) allows you to talk with most models deployed in Azure AI Foundry with the same code and structure, including DeepSeek-R1.
+
+### Create a client to consume the model
+
+First, create the client to consume the model. The following code uses an endpoint URL and key that are stored in environment variables.
+
+
+```python
+import os
+from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
+from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
+
+client = ChatCompletionsClient(
+    endpoint=os.environ["AZURE_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT"],
+    credential=AzureKeyCredential(os.environ["AZURE_INFERENCE_CREDENTIAL"]),
+)
+```
+
+### Get the model's capabilities
+
+The `/info` route returns information about the model that is deployed to the endpoint. Return the model's information by calling the following method:
+
+
+```python
+model_info = client.get_model_info()
+```
+
+The response is as follows:
+
+
+```python
+print("Model name:", model_info.model_name)
+print("Model type:", model_info.model_type)
+print("Model provider name:", model_info.model_provider_name)
+```
+
+```console
+Model name: DeepSeek-R1
+Model type: chat-completions
+Model provider name: DeepSeek
+```
+
+### Create a chat completion request
+
+The following example shows how you can create a basic chat completions request to the model.
+
+```python
+from azure.ai.inference.models import SystemMessage, UserMessage
+
+response = client.complete(
+    messages=[
+        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
+        UserMessage(content="How many languages are in the world?"),
+    ],
+)
+```
+
+The response is as follows, where you can see the model's usage statistics:
+
+
+```python
+print("Response:", response.choices[0].message.content)
+print("Model:", response.model)
+print("Usage:")
+print("\tPrompt tokens:", response.usage.prompt_tokens)
+print("\tTotal tokens:", response.usage.total_tokens)
+print("\tCompletion tokens:", response.usage.completion_tokens)
+```
+
+```console
+Response: As of now, it's estimated that there are about 7,000 languages spoken around the world. However, this number can vary as some languages become extinct and new ones develop. It's also important to note that the number of speakers can greatly vary between languages, with some having millions of speakers and others only a few hundred.
+Model: DeepSeek-R1
+Usage: 
+  Prompt tokens: 19
+  Total tokens: 91
+  Completion tokens: 72
+```
+
+Inspect the `usage` section in the response to see the number of tokens used for the prompt, the total number of tokens generated, and the number of tokens used for the completion.
+
+#### Understanding reasoning
+
+Some reasoning models, like DeepSeek-R1, generate completions and include the reasoning behind it. The reasoning associated with the completion is included in the response's content within the tags `<think>` and `</think>`. The model may select on which scenarios to generate reasoning content. For example:
+
+
+```python
+response = client.complete(
+    messages=[
+        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
+        UserMessage(content="How many languages are in the world?"),
+    ],
+)
+```
+
+You can extract the reasoning content from the response to understand the model's thought process as follows:
+
+
+```python
+import re
+
+match = re.match(r"<think>(.*?)</think>(.*)", response.choices[0].message.content, re.DOTALL)
+
+print("Response:", )
+if match:
+    print("\tThinking:", match.group(1))
+    print("\tAnswer:", match.group(2))
+else:
+    print("\tAnswer:", response.choices[0].message.content)

+Thinking: Okay, the user is asking how many languages exist in the world. I need to provide a clear and accurate answer. Let's start by recalling the general consensus from linguistic sources. I remember that the number often cited is around 7,000, but maybe I should check some reputable organizations.\n\nEthnologue is a well-known resource for language data, and I think they list about 7,000 languages. But wait, do they update their numbers? It might be around 7,100 or so. Also, the exact count can vary because some sources might categorize dialects differently or have more recent data. \n\nAnother thing to consider is language endangerment. Many languages are endangered, with some having only a few speakers left. Organizations like UNESCO track endangered languages, so mentioning that adds context. Also, the distribution isn't even. Some countries have hundreds of languages, like Papua New Guinea with over 800, while others have just a few. \n\nA user might also wonder why the exact number is hard to pin down. It's because the distinction between a language and a dialect can be political or cultural. For example, Mandarin and Cantonese are considered dialects of Chinese by some, but they're mutually unintelligible, so others classify them as separate languages. Also, some regions are under-researched, making it hard to document all languages. \n\nI should also touch on language families. The 7,000 languages are grouped into families like Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Niger-Congo, etc. Maybe mention a few of the largest families. But wait, the question is just about the count, not the families. Still, it's good to provide a bit more context. \n\nI need to make sure the information is up-to-date. Let me think â€“ recent estimates still hover around 7,000. However, languages are dying out rapidly, so the number decreases over time. Including that note about endangerment and language extinction rates could be helpful. For instance, it's often stated that a language dies every few weeks. \n\nAnother point is sign languages. Does the count include them? Ethnologue includes some, but not all sources might. If the user is including sign languages, that adds more to the count, but I think the 7,000 figure typically refers to spoken languages. For thoroughness, maybe mention that there are also over 300 sign languages. \n\nSummarizing, the answer should state around 7,000, mention Ethnologue's figure, explain why the exact number varies, touch on endangerment, and possibly note sign languages as a separate category. Also, a brief mention of Papua New Guinea as the most linguistically diverse country. \n\nWait, let me verify Ethnologue's current number. As of their latest edition (25th, 2022), they list 7,168 living languages. But I should check if that's the case. Some sources might round to 7,000. Also, SIL International publishes Ethnologue, so citing them as reference makes sense. \n\nOther sources, like Glottolog, might have a different count because they use different criteria. Glottolog might list around 7,000 as well, but exact numbers vary. It's important to highlight that the count isn't exact because of differing definitions and ongoing research. \n\nIn conclusion, the approximate number is 7,000, with Ethnologue being a key source, considerations of endangerment, and the challenges in counting due to dialect vs. language distinctions. I should make sure the answer is clear, acknowledges the variability, and provides key points succinctly.
+
+Answer: The exact number of languages in the world is challenging to determine due to differences in definitions (e.g., distinguishing languages from dialects) and ongoing documentation efforts. However, widely cited estimates suggest there are approximately **7,000 languages** globally.

+
+#### Stream content
+
+By default, the completions API returns the entire generated content in a single response. If you're generating long completions, waiting for the response can take many seconds.
+
+You can _stream_ the content to get it as it's being generated. Streaming content allows you to start processing the completion as content becomes available. This mode returns an object that streams back the response as [data-only server-sent events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#server-sent-events). Extract chunks from the delta field, rather than the message field.
+
+
+```python
+result = client.complete(
+    messages=[
+        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
+        UserMessage(content="How many languages are in the world?"),
+    ],
+    temperature=0,
+    top_p=1,
+    max_tokens=2048,
+    stream=True,
+)
+```
+
+To stream completions, set `stream=True` when you call the model.
+
+To visualize the output, define a helper function to print the stream.
+
+```python
+def print_stream(result):
+    """
+    Prints the chat completion with streaming.
+    """
+    for update in result:
+        if update.choices:
+            print(update.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
+```
+
+You can visualize how streaming generates content:
+
+
+```python
+print_stream(result)
+```
+
+### Apply content safety
+
+The Azure AI model inference API supports [Azure AI content safety](https://aka.ms/azureaicontentsafety). When you use deployments with Azure AI content safety turned on, inputs and outputs pass through an ensemble of classification models aimed at detecting and preventing the output of harmful content. The content filtering system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions.
+
+The following example shows how to handle events when the model detects harmful content in the input prompt and content safety is enabled.
+
+
+```python
+from azure.ai.inference.models import AssistantMessage, UserMessage, SystemMessage
+
+try:
+    response = client.complete(
+        messages=[
+            SystemMessage(content="You are an AI assistant that helps people find information."),
+            UserMessage(content="Chopping tomatoes and cutting them into cubes or wedges are great ways to practice your knife skills."),
+        ]
+    )
+
+    print(response.choices[0].message.content)
+
+except HttpResponseError as ex:
+    if ex.status_code == 400:
+        response = ex.response.json()
+        if isinstance(response, dict) and "error" in response:
+            print(f"Your request triggered an {response['error']['code']} error:\n\t {response['error']['message']}")
+        else:

+## DeepSeek-R1
+
+DeepSeek-R1 builds on the progress of earlier reasoning-focused models that improved performance by extending Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. DeepSeek-R1 takes things further by combining reinforcement learning (RL) with fine-tuning on carefully chosen datasets. It evolved from an earlier version, DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which relied solely on RL and showed strong reasoning skills but had issues like hard-to-read outputs and language inconsistencies. To address these limitations, DeepSeek-R1 incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and follows a refined training pipeline that blends reasoning-oriented RL with supervised fine-tuning on curated datasets, resulting in a model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning benchmarks.
+
+
+You can learn more about the models in their respective model card:
+
+* [DeepSeek-R1](https://aka.ms/azureai/landing/DeepSeek-R1)
+
+
+## Prerequisites
+
+To use DeepSeek-R1 with Azure AI Foundry, you need the following prerequisites:
+
+### A model deployment
+
+**Deployment to serverless APIs**
+
+DeepSeek-R1 can be deployed to serverless API endpoints with pay-as-you-go billing. This kind of deployment provides a way to consume models as an API without hosting them on your subscription, while keeping the enterprise security and compliance that organizations need. 
+
+Deployment to a serverless API endpoint doesn't require quota from your subscription. If your model isn't deployed already, use the Azure AI Studio, Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python, the Azure CLI, or ARM templates to [deploy the model as a serverless API](deploy-models-serverless.md).
+
+> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
+> [Deploy the model to serverless API endpoints](deploy-models-serverless.md)
+
+### The inference package installed
+
+You can consume predictions from this model by using the `@azure-rest/ai-inference` package from `npm`. To install this package, you need the following prerequisites:
+
+* LTS versions of `Node.js` with `npm`.
+* The endpoint URL. To construct the client library, you need to pass in the endpoint URL. The endpoint URL has the form `https://your-host-name.your-azure-region.inference.ai.azure.com`, where `your-host-name` is your unique model deployment host name and `your-azure-region` is the Azure region where the model is deployed (for example, eastus2).
+* Depending on your model deployment and authentication preference, you need either a key to authenticate against the service, or Microsoft Entra ID credentials. The key is a 32-character string.
+
+Once you have these prerequisites, install the Azure Inference library for JavaScript with the following command:
+
+```bash
+npm install @azure-rest/ai-inference
+```
+
+## Work with chat completions
+
+In this section, you use the [Azure AI model inference API](https://aka.ms/azureai/modelinference) with a chat completions model for chat.
+
+> [!TIP]
+> The [Azure AI model inference API](https://aka.ms/azureai/modelinference) allows you to talk with most models deployed in Azure AI Foundry with the same code and structure, including DeepSeek-R1.
+
+### Create a client to consume the model
+
+First, create the client to consume the model. The following code uses an endpoint URL and key that are stored in environment variables.
+
+
+```javascript
+import ModelClient from "@azure-rest/ai-inference";
+import { isUnexpected } from "@azure-rest/ai-inference";
+import { AzureKeyCredential } from "@azure/core-auth";
+
+const client = new ModelClient(
+    process.env.AZURE_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT, 
+    new AzureKeyCredential(process.env.AZURE_INFERENCE_CREDENTIAL)
+);
+```
+
+### Get the model's capabilities
+
+The `/info` route returns information about the model that is deployed to the endpoint. Return the model's information by calling the following method:
+
+
+```javascript
+var model_info = await client.path("/info").get()
+```
+
+The response is as follows:
+
+
+```javascript
+console.log("Model name: ", model_info.body.model_name)
+console.log("Model type: ", model_info.body.model_type)
+console.log("Model provider name: ", model_info.body.model_provider_name)
+```
+
+```console
+Model name: DeepSeek-R1
+Model type: chat-completions
+Model provider name: DeepSeek
+```
+
+### Create a chat completion request
+
+The following example shows how you can create a basic chat completions request to the model.
+
+```javascript
+var messages = [
+    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant" },
+    { role: "user", content: "How many languages are in the world?" },
+];
+
+var response = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
+    body: {
+        messages: messages,
+    }
+});
+```
+
+The response is as follows, where you can see the model's usage statistics:
+
+
+```javascript
+if (isUnexpected(response)) {
+    throw response.body.error;
+}
+
+console.log("Response: ", response.body.choices[0].message.content);
+console.log("Model: ", response.body.model);
+console.log("Usage:");
+console.log("\tPrompt tokens:", response.body.usage.prompt_tokens);
+console.log("\tTotal tokens:", response.body.usage.total_tokens);
+console.log("\tCompletion tokens:", response.body.usage.completion_tokens);
+```
+
+```console
+Response: As of now, it's estimated that there are about 7,000 languages spoken around the world. However, this number can vary as some languages become extinct and new ones develop. It's also important to note that the number of speakers can greatly vary between languages, with some having millions of speakers and others only a few hundred.
+Model: DeepSeek-R1
+Usage: 
+  Prompt tokens: 19
+  Total tokens: 91
+  Completion tokens: 72
+```
+
+Inspect the `usage` section in the response to see the number of tokens used for the prompt, the total number of tokens generated, and the number of tokens used for the completion.
+
+#### Understanding reasoning
+
+Some reasoning models, like DeepSeek-R1, generate completions and include the reasoning behind it. The reasoning associated with the completion is included in the response's content within the tags `<think>` and `</think>`. The model may select on which scenarios to generate reasoning content. For example:
+
+
+```javascript
+var messages = [
+    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant" },
+    { role: "user", content: "How many languages are in the world?" },
+];
+
+var response = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
+    body: {
+        messages: messages,
+    }
+});
+```
+
+You can extract the reasoning content from the response to understand the model's thought process as follows:
+
+
+```javascript
+var content = response.body.choices[0].message.content
+var match = content.match(/<think>(.*?)<\/think>(.*)/s);
+
+console.log("Response:");
+if (match) {
+    console.log("\tThinking:", match[1]);
+    console.log("\Answer:", match[2]);
+}
+else {
+    console.log("Response:", content);
+}
+console.log("Model: ", response.body.model);
+console.log("Usage:");
+console.log("\tPrompt tokens:", response.body.usage.prompt_tokens);
+console.log("\tTotal tokens:", response.body.usage.total_tokens);
+console.log("\tCompletion tokens:", response.body.usage.completion_tokens);
+```

+Inspect the `usage` section in the response to see the number of tokens used for the prompt, the total number of tokens generated, and the number of tokens used for the completion.
+
+#### Understanding reasoning
+
+Some reasoning models, like DeepSeek-R1, generate completions and include the reasoning behind it. The reasoning associated with the completion is included in the response's content within the tags `<think>` and `</think>`. The model may select on which scenarios to generate reasoning content. For example:
+
+
+```csharp
+ChatCompletionsOptions requestOptions = new ChatCompletionsOptions()
+{
+    Messages = {
+        new ChatRequestSystemMessage("You are a helpful assistant."),
+        new ChatRequestUserMessage("How many languages are in the world?")
+    },
+};
+
+Response<ChatCompletions> response = client.Complete(requestOptions);
+```
+
+You can extract the reasoning content from the response to understand the model's thought process as follows:
+
+
+```csharp
+Regex regex = new Regex(pattern, RegexOptions.Singleline);
+Match match = regex.Match(response.Value.Content);
+
+Console.WriteLine("Response:");
+if (match.Success)
+{
+    Console.WriteLine($"\tThinking: {match.Groups[1].Value}");
+    Console.WriteLine($"\tAnswer: {match.Groups[2].Value}");
+else
+{
+    Console.WriteLine($"Response: {response.Value.Content}");
+}
+Console.WriteLine($"Model: {response.Value.Model}");
+Console.WriteLine("Usage:");
+Console.WriteLine($"\tPrompt tokens: {response.Value.Usage.PromptTokens}");
+Console.WriteLine($"\tTotal tokens: {response.Value.Usage.TotalTokens}");
+Console.WriteLine($"\tCompletion tokens: {response.Value.Usage.CompletionTokens}");
+```
+
+```console
+Thinking: Okay, the user is asking how many languages exist in the world. I need to provide a clear and accurate answer. Let's start by recalling the general consensus from linguistic sources. I remember that the number often cited is around 7,000, but maybe I should check some reputable organizations.\n\nEthnologue is a well-known resource for language data, and I think they list about 7,000 languages. But wait, do they update their numbers? It might be around 7,100 or so. Also, the exact count can vary because some sources might categorize dialects differently or have more recent data. \n\nAnother thing to consider is language endangerment. Many languages are endangered, with some having only a few speakers left. Organizations like UNESCO track endangered languages, so mentioning that adds context. Also, the distribution isn't even. Some countries have hundreds of languages, like Papua New Guinea with over 800, while others have just a few. \n\nA user might also wonder why the exact number is hard to pin down. It's because the distinction between a language and a dialect can be political or cultural. For example, Mandarin and Cantonese are considered dialects of Chinese by some, but they're mutually unintelligible, so others classify them as separate languages. Also, some regions are under-researched, making it hard to document all languages. \n\nI should also touch on language families. The 7,000 languages are grouped into families like Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Niger-Congo, etc. Maybe mention a few of the largest families. But wait, the question is just about the count, not the families. Still, it's good to provide a bit more context. \n\nI need to make sure the information is up-to-date. Let me think â€“ recent estimates still hover around 7,000. However, languages are dying out rapidly, so the number decreases over time. Including that note about endangerment and language extinction rates could be helpful. For instance, it's often stated that a language dies every few weeks. \n\nAnother point is sign languages. Does the count include them? Ethnologue includes some, but not all sources might. If the user is including sign languages, that adds more to the count, but I think the 7,000 figure typically refers to spoken languages. For thoroughness, maybe mention that there are also over 300 sign languages. \n\nSummarizing, the answer should state around 7,000, mention Ethnologue's figure, explain why the exact number varies, touch on endangerment, and possibly note sign languages as a separate category. Also, a brief mention of Papua New Guinea as the most linguistically diverse country. \n\nWait, let me verify Ethnologue's current number. As of their latest edition (25th, 2022), they list 7,168 living languages. But I should check if that's the case. Some sources might round to 7,000. Also, SIL International publishes Ethnologue, so citing them as reference makes sense. \n\nOther sources, like Glottolog, might have a different count because they use different criteria. Glottolog might list around 7,000 as well, but exact numbers vary. It's important to highlight that the count isn't exact because of differing definitions and ongoing research. \n\nIn conclusion, the approximate number is 7,000, with Ethnologue being a key source, considerations of endangerment, and the challenges in counting due to dialect vs. language distinctions. I should make sure the answer is clear, acknowledges the variability, and provides key points succinctly.
+
+Answer: The exact number of languages in the world is challenging to determine due to differences in definitions (e.g., distinguishing languages from dialects) and ongoing documentation efforts. However, widely cited estimates suggest there are approximately **7,000 languages** globally.

+  Total tokens: 897
+  Completion tokens: 886
+```
+
+#### Stream content
+
+By default, the completions API returns the entire generated content in a single response. If you're generating long completions, waiting for the response can take many seconds.
+
+You can _stream_ the content to get it as it's being generated. Streaming content allows you to start processing the completion as content becomes available. This mode returns an object that streams back the response as [data-only server-sent events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#server-sent-events). Extract chunks from the delta field, rather than the message field.
+
+
+```csharp
+static async Task StreamMessageAsync(ChatCompletionsClient client)
+{
+    ChatCompletionsOptions requestOptions = new ChatCompletionsOptions()
+    {
+        Messages = {
+            new ChatRequestSystemMessage("You are a helpful assistant."),
+            new ChatRequestUserMessage("How many languages are in the world? Write an essay about it.")
+        },
+        MaxTokens=4096
+    };
+
+    StreamingResponse<StreamingChatCompletionsUpdate> streamResponse = await client.CompleteStreamingAsync(requestOptions);
+
+    await PrintStream(streamResponse);
+}
+```
+
+To stream completions, use `CompleteStreamingAsync` method when you call the model. Notice that in this example we the call is wrapped in an asynchronous method.
+
+To visualize the output, define an asynchronous method to print the stream in the console.
+
+```csharp
+static async Task PrintStream(StreamingResponse<StreamingChatCompletionsUpdate> response)
+{
+    await foreach (StreamingChatCompletionsUpdate chatUpdate in response)
+    {
+        if (chatUpdate.Role.HasValue)
+        {
+            Console.Write($"{chatUpdate.Role.Value.ToString().ToUpperInvariant()}: ");
+        }
+        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(chatUpdate.ContentUpdate))
+        {
+            Console.Write(chatUpdate.ContentUpdate);
+        }
+    }
+}
+```
+
+You can visualize how streaming generates content:
+
+
+```csharp
+StreamMessageAsync(client).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
+```
+
+### Apply content safety
+
+The Azure AI model inference API supports [Azure AI content safety](https://aka.ms/azureaicontentsafety). When you use deployments with Azure AI content safety turned on, inputs and outputs pass through an ensemble of classification models aimed at detecting and preventing the output of harmful content. The content filtering system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions.
+
+The following example shows how to handle events when the model detects harmful content in the input prompt and content safety is enabled.
+
+
+```csharp
+try
+{
+    requestOptions = new ChatCompletionsOptions()
+    {
+        Messages = {
+            new ChatRequestSystemMessage("You are an AI assistant that helps people find information."),
+            new ChatRequestUserMessage(
+                "Chopping tomatoes and cutting them into cubes or wedges are great ways to practice your knife skills."
+            ),
+        },
+    };
+
+    response = client.Complete(requestOptions);
+    Console.WriteLine(response.Value.Content);
+}
+catch (RequestFailedException ex)
+{
+    if (ex.ErrorCode == "content_filter")
+    {
+        Console.WriteLine($"Your query has trigger Azure Content Safety: {ex.Message}");
+    }
+    else
+    {
+        throw;
+    }
+}
+```

+## DeepSeek-R1
+
+DeepSeek-R1 builds on the progress of earlier reasoning-focused models that improved performance by extending Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. DeepSeek-R1 takes things further by combining reinforcement learning (RL) with fine-tuning on carefully chosen datasets. It evolved from an earlier version, DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which relied solely on RL and showed strong reasoning skills but had issues like hard-to-read outputs and language inconsistencies. To address these limitations, DeepSeek-R1 incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and follows a refined training pipeline that blends reasoning-oriented RL with supervised fine-tuning on curated datasets, resulting in a model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning benchmarks.
+
+
+You can learn more about the models in their respective model card:
+
+* [DeepSeek-R1](https://aka.ms/azureai/landing/DeepSeek-R1)
+
+
+## Prerequisites
+
+To use DeepSeek-R1 with Azure AI Foundry, you need the following prerequisites:
+
+### A model deployment
+
+**Deployment to serverless APIs**
+
+DeepSeek-R1 can be deployed to serverless API endpoints with pay-as-you-go billing. This kind of deployment provides a way to consume models as an API without hosting them on your subscription, while keeping the enterprise security and compliance that organizations need. 
+
+Deployment to a serverless API endpoint doesn't require quota from your subscription. If your model isn't deployed already, use the Azure AI Studio, Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python, the Azure CLI, or ARM templates to [deploy the model as a serverless API](deploy-models-serverless.md).
+
+> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
+> [Deploy the model to serverless API endpoints](deploy-models-serverless.md)
+
+### A REST client
+
+Models deployed with the [Azure AI model inference API](https://aka.ms/azureai/modelinference) can be consumed using any REST client. To use the REST client, you need the following prerequisites:
+
+* To construct the requests, you need to pass in the endpoint URL. The endpoint URL has the form `https://your-host-name.your-azure-region.inference.ai.azure.com`, where `your-host-name`` is your unique model deployment host name and `your-azure-region`` is the Azure region where the model is deployed (for example, eastus2).
+* Depending on your model deployment and authentication preference, you need either a key to authenticate against the service, or Microsoft Entra ID credentials. The key is a 32-character string.
+
+## Work with chat completions
+
+In this section, you use the [Azure AI model inference API](https://aka.ms/azureai/modelinference) with a chat completions model for chat.
+
+> [!TIP]
+> The [Azure AI model inference API](https://aka.ms/azureai/modelinference) allows you to talk with most models deployed in Azure AI Foundry with the same code and structure, including DeepSeek-R1.
+
+### Create a client to consume the model
+
+First, create the client to consume the model. The following code uses an endpoint URL and key that are stored in environment variables.
+
+### Get the model's capabilities
+
+The `/info` route returns information about the model that is deployed to the endpoint. Return the model's information by calling the following method:
+
+```http
+GET /info HTTP/1.1
+Host: <ENDPOINT_URI>
+Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
+Content-Type: application/json
+```
+
+The response is as follows:
+
+
+```json
+{
+    "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1",
+    "model_type": "chat-completions",
+    "model_provider_name": "DeepSeek"
+}
+```
+
+### Create a chat completion request
+
+The following example shows how you can create a basic chat completions request to the model.
+
+```json
+{
+    "model": "DeepSeek-R1",
+    "messages": [
+        {
+            "role": "system",
+            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
+        },
+        {
+            "role": "user",
+            "content": "How many languages are in the world?"
+        }
+    ]
+}
+```
+
+The response is as follows, where you can see the model's usage statistics:
+
+
+```json
+{
+    "id": "0a1234b5de6789f01gh2i345j6789klm",

+                "content": "As of now, it's estimated that there are about 7,000 languages spoken around the world. However, this number can vary as some languages become extinct and new ones develop. It's also important to note that the number of speakers can greatly vary between languages, with some having millions of speakers and others only a few hundred.",

+    ],
+    "usage": {
+        "prompt_tokens": 19,
+        "total_tokens": 91,
+        "completion_tokens": 72
+    }
+}
+```
+
+Inspect the `usage` section in the response to see the number of tokens used for the prompt, the total number of tokens generated, and the number of tokens used for the completion.
+
+#### Understanding reasoning
+
+Some reasoning models, like DeepSeek-R1, generate completions and include the reasoning behind it. The reasoning associated with the completion is included in the response's content within the tags `<think>` and `</think>`. The model may select on which scenarios to generate reasoning content. For example:
+
+
+```json
+{
+    "model": "DeepSeek-R1",
+    "messages": [
+        {

+            "role": "user",
+            "content": "How many languages are in the world?"
+        }
+    ]
+}

+
+### Apply content safety
+
+The Azure AI model inference API supports [Azure AI content safety](https://aka.ms/azureaicontentsafety). When you use deployments with Azure AI content safety turned on, inputs and outputs pass through an ensemble of classification models aimed at detecting and preventing the output of harmful content. The content filtering system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions.
+
+The following example shows how to handle events when the model detects harmful content in the input prompt and content safety is enabled.
+
+
+```json
+{
+    "model": "DeepSeek-R1",
+    "messages": [
+        {
+            "role": "system",
+            "content": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information."
+        },
+                {
+            "role": "user",
+            "content": "Chopping tomatoes and cutting them into cubes or wedges are great ways to practice your knife skills."
+        }
+    ]
+}
+```
+
+

+## Cost and quota considerations for DeepSeek models deployed as serverless API endpoints
+
+Quota is managed per deployment. Each deployment has a rate limit of 200,000 tokens per minute and 1,000 API requests per minute. However, we currently limit one deployment per model per project. Contact Microsoft Azure Support if the current rate limits aren't sufficient for your scenarios.

Use this value when you want to pass parameters that you know the underlying model can support. Using `drop` makes the API to drop any unsupported parameter. Use this value when you need to use the same payload across different models, but one of the extra parameters may make a model to error out if not supported. Using `error` makes the API to reject any extra parameter in the payload. Only parameters specified in this API can be indicated, or a 400 error is returned. |

-## Request Body
-
-
-| Name | Required | Type | Description |
-| --- | --- | --- | --- |
-| prompt | True |     | The prompts to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays. Note that `<\|endoftext\|>` is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model generates as if from the beginning of a new document. |
-| frequency\_penalty |     | number | Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. |
-| max\_tokens |     | integer | The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the completion. The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` cannot exceed the model's context length. |
-| presence\_penalty |     | number | Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. |
-| seed |     | integer | If specified, the model makes a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.<br><br>Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend. |
-| stop |     |     | Sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence. |
-| stream |     | boolean | Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. |
-| temperature |     | number | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.<br><br>We generally recommend altering `temperature` or `top_p` but not both. |
-| top\_p |     | number | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.<br><br>We generally recommend altering `top_p` or `temperature` but not both. |

-| index | integer | The index of the choice in the list of choices. |
-| text | string | The generated text. |
-
-

-
-
-### CreateCompletionRequest
-
-
-| Name | Type | Default Value | Description |
-| --- | --- | --- | --- |
-| frequency\_penalty | number | 0   | Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. |
-| max\_tokens | integer | 256 | The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the completion. The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` cannot exceed the model's context length. |
-| presence\_penalty | number | 0   | Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. |
-| prompt |     | `<\|endoftext\|>` | The prompts to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays. Note that `<\|endoftext\|>` is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model generates as if from the beginning of a new document. |
-| seed | integer |     | If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.<br><br>Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend. |
-| stop |     |     | Sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence. |
-| stream | boolean | False | Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. |
-| temperature | number | 1   | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.<br><br>We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. |
-| top\_p | number | 1   | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.<br><br>We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both. |

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "breaking change",
    "modification_title": "Remove Reference for Model Inference Completions"
}
```

### Explanation
The modification involves the complete removal of the `reference-model-inference-completions.md` file from the documentation repository, which contained critical information regarding the Azure AI Model Inference Completions API.

This file included details such as the API endpoint, parameters, request and response formats, and various error handling scenarios. Deleting this document represents a breaking change since users who relied on this reference for implementation will no longer have access to essential guidelines for using the Model Inference Completions API.

Such a removal could indicate a significant update or restructuring of the API itself, necessitating users to find alternative resources or updated documentation to understand the latest functionalities and best practices surrounding model inference completions. The lack of reference can impact developers and users who depend heavily on the documentation for operational and implementation guidance. It emphasizes the need for timely communication of such changes to those affected within the Azure AI community.

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Update Table of Contents for AI Studio"
}
```

### Explanation
The recent changes made to the `toc.yml` file for the AI Studio documentation reflect a minor update that reorganizes the structure of the Table of Contents. This modification includes the addition of new content and the restructuring of existing sections to enhance usability.

Three new entries have been introduced, including a reference to the "DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models." This addition provides users with updated resources related to deploying and using these models within the AI Studio framework. 

Conversely, several existing links and sub-items related to the "Azure AI Model Inference API" have been removed and replaced with a single direct link to a new reference document. This streamlining of content reflects an effort to consolidate information, potentially making it easier for users to navigate the documentation.

Overall, these updates contribute to better content accessibility and clarity within the AI Studio documentation, making it easier for users to find relevant guides and references as they work with Azure's capabilities.
