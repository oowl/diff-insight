# Insights

The series of updates reflect a concerted effort to maintain the relevancy and accuracy of technical documentation concerning Azure AI Search. Here is a more detailed exploration of these changes:

**Date Updates and Consistency**

One prevalent modification across the documents is the adjustment of publication dates to January 2025. This reflects an initiative to present users with the most current version of the documentation, assuring that the guidelines they follow align with the latest offerings and best practices provided by Azure AI Search. Regular date updates can also be indicative of ongoing support and iteration of the documentation, even if substantive content changes are minimal.

**Clarity and Terminology Standardization**

Several documents underwent minor language improvements to enhance clarity. For instance, the change from "[search service name]" to "[YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME]" in URL placeholders is intended to provide clearer instructions to users, guiding them to replace these placeholders with their specific service names. Such changes, though small, are critical in minimizing user errors and improving the overall accessibility of the documentation.

Additionally, the capitalization adjustment in the term "Entity" in "Bing Entity Search API" aligns with the proper noun formatting, ensuring consistency throughout the documentation. Standardizing terminology helps in reinforcing the correct usage and promotes professional documentation standards.

**Enhanced Understanding and Accessibility**

Efforts to improve language readability, such as rephrasing sentences for grammatical accuracy or simplifying phrases, demonstrate active attempts to make the documentation more user-friendly. This is especially beneficial for readers with varying degrees of technical proficiency, helping bridge potential gaps in understanding through clearer and more direct communication.

In conclusion, while these updates might appear to be minor in nature, they collectively contribute to a more refined and robust set of documentation. They play a vital role in supporting users by ensuring accuracy, enhancing understanding, and maintaining high standards of technical writing within Microsoft's Azure AI Search ecosystem. These continuous improvements in documentation signal a commitment to delivering reliable and high-quality educational resources, which are essential for effective technology adoption and user satisfaction.

 # How to model relational SQL data for import and indexing in Azure AI Search
 
-Azure AI Search accepts a flat rowset as input to the [indexing pipeline](search-what-is-an-index.md). If your source data originates from joined tables in a SQL Server relational database, this article explains how to construct the result set, and how to model a parent-child relationship in an Azure AI Search index.
+Azure AI Search accepts a flat rowset as input to the [indexing pipeline](search-what-is-an-index.md). If your source data originates from joined tables in a SQL Server relational database, this article explains how to construct the rowset, and how to model a parent-child relationship in an Azure AI Search index.
 
 As an illustration, we refer to a hypothetical hotels database, based on [demo data](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-sample-data/tree/main/hotels). Assume the database consists of a `Hotels$` table with 50 hotels, and a `Rooms$` table with rooms of varying types, rates, and amenities, for a total of 750 rooms. There's a one-to-many relationship between the tables. In our approach, a view provides the query that returns 50 rows, one row per hotel, with associated room detail embedded into each row.

A query on "hotels in Florida" would return seven results for just the Old Century Hotel, pushing other relevant hotels deep into the search results.
