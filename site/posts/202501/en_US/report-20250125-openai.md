 Data zone batch deployments provide all the same functionality as [global batch deployments](./batch.md) while allowing you to leverage Azure global infrastructure to dynamically route traffic to only data centers within the Microsoft defined data zone with the best availability for each request. 
 
 ## Standard
 
+**SKU name in code:** `Standard`
+
 Standard deployments provide a pay-per-call billing model on the chosen model. Provides the fastest way to get started as you only pay for what you consume. Models available in each region as well as throughput may be limited.  
 
 Standard deployments are optimized for low to medium volume workloads with high burstiness. Customers with high consistent volume may experience greater latency variability.
 
 ## Provisioned
 
+**SKU name in code:** `ProvisionedManaged`
+
 Provisioned deployments allow you to specify the amount of throughput you require in a deployment. The service then allocates the necessary model processing capacity and ensures it's ready for you. Throughput is defined in terms of provisioned throughput units (PTU) which is a normalized way of representing the throughput for your deployment. Each model-version pair requires different amounts of PTU to deploy and provide different amounts of throughput per PTU. Learn more from our [Provisioned throughput concepts article](../concepts/provisioned-throughput.md).

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Updated Model Matrix for Azure OpenAI Standard and Global"
}
```

### Explanation
The changes to the `standard-global.md` documentation involve a complete overhaul of the existing content, consisting of 26 additions and 26 deletions, amounting to a total of 52 changes. The most notable alteration is the update of the document date from October 25, 2024, to January 23, 2025, indicating a refreshed revision.

The main focus of these modifications is the restructuring of the model matrix that outlines the compatibility of various models in different Azure regions. A new SKU, "**gpt-4o-audio-preview**," has been added to the matrix. This addition is reflected on the last column of the table, which details the availability of different models across various geographical regions.

The format of the matrix itself remains consistent, listing regions and models in a clear tabular structure. Each model's availability (marked with a tick symbol "✅" or left blank) across the various regions allows users to easily identify which models are accessible in which locations. Overall, the update enhances the clarity and usefulness of the documentation for users looking to deploy specific Azure OpenAI models in suitable regions.
