### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Formatting Correction in Realtime Audio Reference Documentation"
}
```

### Explanation
The changes made to the `realtime-audio-reference.md` documentation involve a minor formatting correction that clarifies the presentation of details regarding input token information in responses. Specifically, there was a mistake in the original markdown format where an extraneous "<br>" tag was incorrectly placed.

The adjustment updates the line pertaining to the `input_token_details` object to ensure proper readability and formatting. This correction helps users better understand the nested properties under the `input_token_details`, improving the overall user experience and comprehension of the documentation.

By maintaining accurate formatting throughout the documentation, it ensures that developers can easily parse and understand the information regarding how tokens are managed within the real-time audio API, contributing to more effective implementation of the Azure OpenAI services.
