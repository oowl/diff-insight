# Highlights
The modifications primarily focus on updating references from "Azure AI Foundry portal" or "ai-studio" to the more accurate "Azure AI Foundry" or "ai-foundry" across various documentation files in the Azure AI services. This ensures that users are provided with consistent and correct navigation paths to the necessary resources.

## New features
No new features were introduced in this diff. The changes are refinements for consistency and accuracy of documentation.

## Breaking changes
There were no breaking changes introduced within this set of updates. All modifications revolve around updating references to improve user navigation and understanding.

## Other updates
Significant updates involve changing outdated links within multiple documentation pages:
- **Document Intelligence and Language Service**: Reference in `studio-overview.md` was updated to remove "portal," optimizing language consistency.
- Numerous files within the **Language Service** documentation for features like Key Phrase Extraction, Language Detection, Named Entity Recognition, Personally Identifiable Information, Sentiment-Opinion Mining, Summarization, and Text Analytics for Health had their links corrected from paths labeled "ai-studio" to "ai-foundry."

# Insights
The updates reflect a broad housekeeping initiative aimed at maintaining the accuracy of the Azure AI service documentation. By ensuring that outdated links and references are corrected, the changes significantly enhance the documentation's utility, enabling a more seamless user experience and preventing confusion among users trying to access Azure AI resources.

The consistent reference to "Azure AI Foundry" across the documentation ensures that all users, regardless of the specific AI service they are utilizing, have access to accurate and functional navigation aids.

 Azure AI Language Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection is a feature offered by [Azure AI Language](../overview.md). The PII detection service is a cloud-based API that utilizes machine learning and AI algorithms to help you develop intelligent applications with advanced natural language understanding. Azure AI Language PII detection uses Named Entity Recognition (NER) to **identify and redact** sensitive information from input data. The service classifies sensitive personal data into predefined categories. These categories include phone numbers, email addresses, and identification documents. This classification helps to efficiently detect and eliminate such information.
