# Highlights
The recent update to various Azure AI Search documentation focuses on a terminology change to enhance clarity and consistency. The repeated alteration involves changing references from "Azure AI multi-service" to "Azure AI services multi-service." This uniformity improves user comprehension across multiple documents without altering the core content structure.

## New Features
- Consistent terminology for Azure AI services across multiple guides and tutorials.

## Breaking Changes
- None; modifications were strictly terminological.

## Other Updates
- Enhanced link accuracy in tutorials to guide users to more relevant sections.
- Emphasis on correct regional configuration for Azure AI service accounts.

# Insights
In technical documentation, clarity and consistency are critical. The recent updates to Azure AI Search documentation embody these principles by refining how Azure services are described. Originally referred to inconsistently as "Azure AI multiservice" or "Azure AI multi-service resource," the standardized term "Azure AI services multi-service" now aligns with Microsoft's broader documentation strategy, promoting ease of understanding for users engaging with these materials.

Such terminology adjustments might seem minor but play a significant role in reducing confusion, especially for novice users or those integrating multiple Azure services. By ensuring terminological clarity, these updates help users more effectively navigate the documentation and make precise configurations, vital for leveraging Azure's capabilities, such as AI enrichment, image vectorization, and data chunking.

Furthermore, the corrections made to hyperlink destinations in the tutorial sections highlight Microsoft's commitment to ensuring users have seamless access to relevant instructional content, facilitating smoother on-boarding and usage experiences. As Azure continues to evolve, maintaining such documentation accuracy helps ensure that users can keep pace with updated practices and standards.

Overall, this batch of updates demonstrates a meticulous approach to technical communication, emphasizing that even minor changes can substantially enhance user experience when handled with care and attention to consistency and clarity.

 ### Public connection requirements
 
-Depending on when your search service was created, and its tier and region, billing for [built-in skills](cognitive-search-predefined-skills.md) can require a public connection from Azure AI Search to Azure AI multi-service. Disabling public network access breaks billing in some scenarios. Review the requirements for [connections through a shared private link](search-indexer-howto-access-private.md) to determine whether your search service requires a public connection.
