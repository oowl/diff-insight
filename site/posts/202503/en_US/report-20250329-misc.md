# Insights

The importance of maintaining accurate and consistent terminology in technical documentation cannot be overstated. In the world of software development, precise language is crucial, as it helps prevent misunderstandings and ensures that technical documentation remains a reliable resource for users. 

In this particular modification, the term "NodeJS" was changed to "Node.js" to align with the correct and widely accepted branding of the Node.js platform. While minor, such an update is meaningful. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, and using the correct capitalization and punctuation (featuring the period) adheres to the branding standards set by the Node.js Foundation.

Correcting the term also enhances clarity for developers and technical readers who rely on the documentation to develop applications using these APIs. It removes ambiguity and aligns the documentation with global standards, thereby fostering a sense of professionalism and credibility.

This update, involving one addition and one deletion for a total of two adjustments per documentation file, illustrates a commitment to such standards. For contributors and maintainers of technical documentation, consistency and accuracy in terminology help build trust with the user base, demonstrating a meticulous approach to detail that users can depend on for accurate technical guidance.
