# Highlights

The code diff contains updates to two documentation files related to Azure AI services: language detection and question answering. The changes include:

## New features

- Better clarity in the language detection quickstart guide by updating the "country" description to "country/region".

## Breaking changes

- None

## Other updates

- Streamlined Python SDK documentation for Azure Question Answering to enhance readability by removing unnecessary references and markdown formatting.

# Insights

In the first file update within the Azure AI Foundry quickstart guide, the term "country" was refined to "country/region." This minor yet important change enhances the accuracy and applicability of the instructions offered in the guide. By recognizing that some inputs may pertain to regions rather than strictly defined countries, the documentation aligns better with the diverse data environments users may work with. This reflects Azureâ€™s commitment to providing a versatile and accurate language detection service that accommodates a wide range of input contexts globally.

The second update involves improving the Python SDK documentation for Azure Question Answering. By eliminating redundant reference documentation links and simplifying markdown formatting, the content is made more accessible to developers. Such simplifications can significantly enhance user experience by reducing cognitive load and allowing developers to focus directly on implementing and utilizing the features of the SDK without unnecessary navigation through ancillary links or distraction from markdown syntax. This proactively underscores Azure's initiative to maintain documentation that is not only informative but also user-centric.

Overall, these modifications reflect an ongoing effort to fine-tune Azure AI service documentation to make it more comprehensive and user-friendly, facilitating a smoother developer experience and ensuring clearer guidance in utilizing Azure's powerful AI capabilities.

{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Streamline SDK Python documentation for Azure Question Answering"
}
```

### Explanation
The code diff indicates a minor update made to the 'sdk-python.md' file within the Azure AI language service documentation. The modifications involved simplifying the text by removing certain references to the documentation links, making the content cleaner and more concise. Specifically, the references to the [Reference documentation] link were removed to enhance readability. Additionally, URLs that reference functions such as `get_answers` and `get_answers_from_text` were streamlined by taking out the markdown formatting when those functions were mentioned in the text. This results in a clearer and more user-friendly guide for developers utilizing the Python SDK for Azure's Question Answering service. The changes consisted of four additions and six deletions, leading to an overall change of ten lines.
