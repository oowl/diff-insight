# Insights

The recent updates to cognitive search documentation reflect a proactive effort to maintain the accuracy and relevance of the provided information, ensuring that end-users and developers are equipped with precise and clear guidelines. 

### Formatting Correction in `cognitive-search-skill-shaper.md`
The document's JSON structure had a syntactical error corrected by adding a missing quotation mark. This minor fix emphasizes the importance of maintaining proper syntax in documentation, especially when dealing with examples of code structures, to prevent any potential misunderstandings from readers following these guides.

### Detailed Guidance with Notes
In both "search-how-to-index-sql-database.md" and "search-howto-index-mysql.md", the incorporation of notes clarifying character restrictions for container names assists developers in adhering to best practices. By enumerating acceptable characters, these updates promote smoother deployment and configuration experiences by preventing errors related to invalid configuration properties.

### Expansion of Field Mapping Functions
The addition of `fixedLengthEncode` and `toJson` functions in the field mappings documentation provides users with expanded capabilities for transforming data during the indexing process. Such features empower users by extending the functionality of field mappings that are critical in tailoring search indexing to specific application requirements.

### Up-to-Date Information in `search-limits-quotas-capacity.md`
The update of the documentâ€™s date and the simplification of the "Basic" service tier description reflect an effort to ensure that the documentation remains current and accessible. Removing unnecessary complexity in service descriptions aids users in better understanding the offerings without being distracted by irrelevant details about the infrastructure.

In essence, these iterative improvements collectively contribute to a refined and more user-friendly documentation base, which is essential for effective implementation and utilization of cognitive search capabilities. These changes demonstrate a commitment to ongoing document maintenance, a vital aspect of technical communication that supports and enhances user experience.
