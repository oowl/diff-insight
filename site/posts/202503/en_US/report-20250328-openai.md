 GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4o series models are language models that are optimized for conversational interfaces. The models behave differently than the older GPT-3 models. Previous models were text-in and text-out, which means they accepted a prompt string and returned a completion to append to the prompt. However, the latest models are conversation-in and message-out. The models expect input formatted in a specific chat-like transcript format. They return a completion that represents a model-written message in the chat. This format was designed specifically for multi-turn conversations, but it can also work well for nonchat scenarios.

 Azure OpenAI Service provides a **completion endpoint** that can be used for a wide variety of tasks. The endpoint supplies a simple yet powerful text-in, text-out interface to any [Azure OpenAI model](../concepts/models.md). To trigger the completion, you input some text as a prompt. The model generates the completion and attempts to match your context or pattern. Suppose you provide the prompt "As Descartes said, I think, therefore" to the API. For this prompt, Azure OpenAI returns the completion endpoint " I am" with high probability.

 The simple text-in, text-out interface means you can "program" the Azure OpenAI model by providing instructions or just a few examples of what you'd like it to do. The output success generally depends on the complexity of the task and quality of your prompt. A general rule is to think about how you would write a word problem for a pre-teenage student to solve. A well-written prompt provides enough information for the model to know what you want and how it should respond.

 # Learn how to generate embeddings with Azure OpenAI
 
-An embedding is a special format of data representation that can be easily utilized by machine learning models and algorithms. The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar. Embeddings power vector similarity search in Azure Databases such as [Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore](/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/vcore/vector-search) , [Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/ai-artificial-intelligence-intelligent-applications?view=azuresql&preserve-view=true#vector-search) or [Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server](/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/how-to-use-pgvector).

 In this example, after the token count is reached, the oldest messages in the conversation transcript are removed. For efficiency, `del` is used instead of `pop()`. We start at index 1 to always preserve the system message and only remove user or assistant messages. Over time, this method of managing the conversation can cause the conversation quality to degrade as the model gradually loses the context of the earlier portions of the conversation.
 
 An alternative approach is to limit the conversation duration to the maximum token length or a specific number of turns. After the maximum token limit is reached, the model would lose context if you were to allow the conversation to continue. You can prompt the user to begin a new conversation and clear the messages list to start a new conversation with the full token limit available.

 ### Don't use ChatML syntax or special tokens with the chat completion endpoint
 
 Some customers try to use the [legacy ChatML syntax](../how-to/chat-markup-language.md) with the chat completion endpoints and newer models. ChatML was a preview capability that only worked with the legacy completions endpoint with the `gpt-35-turbo` version 0301 model. This model is [slated for retirement](../concepts/model-retirements.md). If you attempt to use ChatML syntax with newer models and the chat completion endpoint, it can result in errors and unexpected model response behavior. We don't recommend this use. This same issue can occur when using common special tokens.
