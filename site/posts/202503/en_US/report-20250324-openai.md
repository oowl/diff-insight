### Explanation
The code diff reflects a minor update to the `assistants-typescript.md` file, focusing on improving the clarity of the setup instructions for users. The specific change is a rephrasing of the first step in the setup section. Previously, the instruction stated, "create a new folder `assistants-quickstart` to contain the application and open Visual Studio Code in that folder." This has now been modified to read, "create a new folder `assistants-quickstart` and go to the quickstart folder with the following command."

This alteration simplifies the instruction, making it more explicit that after creating the folder, users should navigate into it with the command provided. This modification aims to facilitate a smoother setup process for developers working with the TypeScript implementation of the Azure OpenAI service, thereby improving the overall usability of the documentation.

-Content[0]: As of my last update in early 2023, in Azure, several AI services support the use of customer-managed keys (CMKs) through Azure Key Vault. This allows customers to have control over the encryption keys used to secure their data at rest. The services that support this feature typically fall under Azure's range of cognitive services and might include:
+Content[0]: There are many alternatives to sugar that you can use, depending on the type of recipe you’re making and your dietary needs or taste preferences. Here are some popular sugar substitutes:
 
-1. Azure Cognitive Search: It supports using customer-managed keys to encrypt the index data.
-2. Azure Form Recognizer: For data at rest, you can use customer-managed keys for added security.
-3. Azure Text Analytics: CMKs can be used for encrypting your data at rest.
-4. Azure Blob Storage: While not exclusively an AI service, it's often used in conjunction with AI services to store data, and it supports customer-managed keys for encrypting blob data.

+
+### **Natural Sweeteners**  
+1. **Honey**
+   - Sweeter than sugar and adds moisture, with a distinct flavor.
+   - Substitution: Use ¾ cup honey for 1 cup sugar, and reduce the liquid in your recipe by 2 tablespoons. Lower the baking temperature by 25°F to prevent over-browning.
+
+2. **Maple Syrup**
+   - Adds a rich, earthy sweetness with a hint of maple flavor.
+   - Substitution: Use ¾ cup syrup for 1 cup sugar. Reduce liquids by 3 tablespoons.
+
+3. **Agave Nectar**
+   - Sweeter and milder than honey, it dissolves well in cold liquids.
+   - Substitution: Use ⅔ cup agave for 1 cup sugar. Reduce liquids in the recipe slightly.
+
+4. **Molasses**
+   - A byproduct of sugar production with a robust, slightly bitter flavor.
+   - Substitution: Use 1 cup of molasses for 1 cup sugar. Reduce liquid by ¼ cup and consider combining it with other sweeteners due to its strong flavor.
+
+5. **Coconut Sugar**
+   - Made from the sap of coconut palms, it has a rich, caramel-like flavor.
+   - Substitution: Use it in a 1:1 ratio for sugar.
+
+6. **Date Sugar** (or Medjool Dates)
+   - Made from ground, dried dates, or blended into a puree, offering a rich, caramel taste.
+   - Substitution: Use 1:1 for sugar. Adjust liquid in recipes if needed.
+
+---
 
-Note that the support for CMKs can vary by service and sometimes even by the specific feature within the service. Additionally, the landscape of cloud services is fast evolving, and new features, including security capabilities, are frequently added. Therefore, it's recommended to check the latest Azure documentation or contact Azure support for the most current information about CMK support for any specific Azure AI service.

}
```

### Explanation
The code diff presents a minor update to the `chatgpt-dotnet.md` documentation file, specifically aimed at improving the clarity of the setup instructions for using ChatGPT in .NET applications. The change modifies the first step in the setup section from "create a new folder `chat-quickstart` to contain the application and open Visual Studio Code in that folder" to "create a new folder `chat-quickstart` and go to the quickstart folder with the following command."

This refinement clarifies the sequence of actions the user should take, emphasizing the need to navigate into the newly created folder prior to opening Visual Studio Code. By making this small yet significant adjustment, the documentation aims to guide users more effectively through the initial setup process, thereby enhancing their overall experience when getting started with ChatGPT in .NET.

+If you're looking to replace sugar in cooking, baking, or beverages, there are several alternatives you can use depending on your tastes, dietary needs, and the recipe. Here's a list of common sugar substitutes:
+
+### **Natural Sweeteners**
+1. **Honey**
+   - Sweeter than sugar, so you may need less.
+   - Adds moisture to recipes.
+   - Adjust liquids and cooking temperature when baking to avoid over-browning.
+
+2. **Maple Syrup**
+   - Provides a rich, complex flavor.
+   - Can be used in baking, beverages, and sauces.
+   - Reduce the liquid content slightly in recipes.
+
+3. **Agave Syrup**
+   - Sweeter than sugar and has a mild flavor.
+   - Works well in drinks, smoothies, and desserts.
+   - Contains fructose, so use sparingly.
+
+4. **Date Sugar or Date Paste**
+   - Made from dates, it's a whole-food sweetener with fiber and nutrients.
+   - Great for baked goods and smoothies.
+   - May darken recipes due to its color.
+
+5. **Coconut Sugar**
+   - Similar in taste and texture to brown sugar.
+   - Less refined than white sugar.
+   - Slightly lower glycemic index, but still contains calories.
+
+6. **Molasses**

-### Retrieve key and endpoint
 
-To successfully make a call against Azure OpenAI, you'll need an **endpoint** and a **key**.
+### Microsoft Entra ID prerequisites
 
-| Variable name | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
-| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
-| `ENDPOINT`    | The service endpoint can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the endpoint via the **Deployments** page in Azure AI Foundry portal. An example endpoint is: `https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/`. |
-| `API-KEY`     | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. |
+For the recommended keyless authentication with Microsoft Entra ID, you need to:
+- Install the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) used for keyless authentication with Microsoft Entra ID.
+- Assign the `Cognitive Services User` role to your user account. You can assign roles in the Azure portal under **Access control (IAM)** > **Add role assignment**.
 
-Go to your resource in the Azure portal. The **Endpoint and Keys** can be found in the **Resource Management** section. Copy your endpoint and access key as you'll need both for authenticating your API calls. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption.

Here are some popular sugar substitutes:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Natural Sweeteners**\n   - **Maple Syrup**: A natural sweetener with a rich, distinct flavor. Use about ¾ cup of maple syrup for every cup of sugar, and reduce the liquid in the recipe slightly.\n   - **Agave Nectar**: A liquid sweetener that’s sweeter than sugar. Use about ⅔ cup of agave nectar for each cup of sugar, and reduce the liquid in the recipe.\n   - **Coconut Sugar**: Made from the sap of the coconut palm, it has a mild caramel flavor. Substitute in a 1:1 ratio for sugar.\n   - **Molasses**: A by-product of sugar production, molasses is rich in flavor and best for recipes like gingerbread or barbecue sauce. Adjust quantities based on the recipe.\n   - **Stevia (Natural)**: Derived from the stevia plant, it's intensely sweet and available in liquid or powder form. Use sparingly, as a little goes a long way.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Fruit-Based Sweeteners**\n   - **Ripe Bananas**: Mashed bananas work well for baking recipes like muffins or pancakes. Use about ½ cup of mashed banana for every cup of sugar and reduce the liquid slightly.\n   - **Applesauce**: Unsweetened applesauce adds sweetness and moisture to baked goods. Replace sugar in a 1:1 ratio, but reduce the liquid by ¼ cup.\n   - **Dates/Date Paste**: Blend dates with water to make a paste, which works well in recipes like energy bars, cakes, or smoothies. Use in a 1:1 ratio for sugar.\n   - **Fruit Juices (e.g., orange juice)**: Can be used to impart natural sweetness but is best suited for specific recipes like marinades or desserts.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Artificial and Low-Calorie Sweeteners**\n   - **Erythritol**: A sugar alcohol with no calories. Substitute in equal amounts, but be careful as it may cause a cooling sensation in some recipes.\n   - **Xylitol**: Another sugar alcohol, often used in gum and candies. It’s a 1:1 sugar substitute but may affect digestion if consumed in large quantities.\n   - **Monk Fruit Sweetener**: A natural, calorie-free sweetener that’s significantly sweeter than sugar. Follow the product packaging for exact substitution measurements.\n   - **Aspartame, Sucralose, or Saccharin** (Artificial Sweeteners): Often used for calorie reduction in beverages or desserts. Follow package instructions for substitution.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Other Natural Alternatives**\n   - **Brown Rice Syrup**: A sticky, malt-flavored syrup used in granolas or desserts. Substitute 1 ¼ cups of brown rice syrup for every cup of sugar.\n   - **Barley Malt Syrup**: A thick, dark syrup with a distinct flavor. It can replace sugar but might require recipe adjustments due to its strong taste.\n   - **Yacon Syrup**: Made from the root of the yacon plant, it’s similar in texture to molasses and has a mild sweetness.\n\n---\n\n### General Tips for Substituting Sugar:\n- **Adjust Liquids:** Many liquid sweeteners (like honey or maple syrup) require reducing the liquid in the recipe to maintain texture.\n- **Baking Powder Adjustment:** If replacing sugar with an acidic sweetener (e.g., honey or molasses), you might need to add a little baking soda to neutralize acidity.\n- **Flavor Changes:** Some substitutes, like molasses or coconut sugar, have distinct flavors that can influence the taste of your recipe.\n- **Browning:** Sugar contributes to caramelization and browning in baked goods. Some alternatives may yield lighter-colored results.\n\nBy trying out different substitutes, you can find what works best for your recipes!",

+There are several ingredients that can be used as substitutes for sugar, depending on the recipe and your dietary preferences. Here are some popular options:
+
 ---
 
+### **Natural Sweeteners**
+1. **Maple Syrup**
+   - Flavor: Rich and slightly caramel-like.
+   - Use: Works well in baking, sauces, oatmeal, and beverages.
+   - Substitution: Replace sugar in a 1:1 ratio but reduce the liquid in your recipe by about 3 tablespoons per cup of maple syrup.
 
-## Create a new PowerShell script

+### Tips for Substitution:
+- Adjust for sweetness: Some substitutes are sweeter or less sweet than sugar, so amounts may need tweaking.
+- Baking considerations: Sugar affects texture, browning, and moisture. If you replace it, you may need to experiment to get the desired result.
+- Liquid adjustments: Many natural sweeteners are liquid, so you’ll often need to reduce the amount of liquid in your recipe.

-Create a new Gradle project.
+1. Install the Azure OpenAI SDK and dependencies.
 
-In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 
+   ```console
+   mvn clean dependency:copy-dependencies
+   ```
 
-```console
-mkdir myapp && cd myapp
-```
+1. For the **recommended** keyless authentication with Microsoft Entra ID, sign in to Azure with the following command:
 
-Run the `gradle init` command from your working directory. This command will create essential build files for Gradle, including *build.gradle.kts*, which is used at runtime to create and configure your application.
+    ```console
+    az login
+    ```
 
-```console
-gradle init --type basic

### Explanation
The code diff reflects a minor update to the `dall-e-javascript.md` documentation file, which provides guidance on generating images using the Azure OpenAI SDK for JavaScript. This modification includes a single addition and a deletion, resulting in a total of two changes.

The specific enhancement made is a clarification in the setup instructions:

- The original instruction instructed users to "open Visual Studio Code in that folder" while the updated instruction simply states to "go to the quickstart folder." This change improves clarity by focusing on navigating into the folder without specifying the IDE, allowing users the freedom to use any environment they prefer.

Overall, this minor update contributes to a clearer and more streamlined set of instructions, enhancing user experience without altering the overall setup process significantly.
