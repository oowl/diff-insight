# Insights

The modification of the API version documentation for inference preview is emblematic of the continuous evolution in AI terminology and structure, particularly as seen in Microsoft's AI services. By shifting from "function_call" and "functions" to "tool_choice" and "tools," the documentation aligns itself with a more standardized and perhaps intuitive lexicon that resembles the broader discourse in AI development. This change is likely reflective of a push towards making AI resources more intuitive for developers, indicating a move to a more developer-friendly API documentation format.

Furthermore, the update in linking to reflect the latest resource pathways in Microsoft Azure is crucial for maintaining the relevance and accuracy of the documentation. This adjustment ensures that users are directed to the most up-to-date information, which is vital in a field where information can quickly become outdated. The replacement of outdated references with current ones mitigates the risk of users relying on deprecated or incorrect information, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and utility of the documentation.

This modification enhances the documentationâ€™s clarity and usability, aiding developers in effectively leveraging AI tools and understanding recent changes and best practices within AI services. By keeping pace with these updates, developers can ensure that they are utilizing the AI tools and services to their fullest potential, backed by accurate and current documentation.
