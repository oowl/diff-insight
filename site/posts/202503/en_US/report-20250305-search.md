+# Configure your Azure AI Search service in the Azure portal
 
-In Azure AI Search, the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) supports a broad range of administrative and content management operations so that you don't have to write code unless you want automation. 
+Configuring your new Azure AI Search service involves several tasks to optimize security, access, and performance. This article provides a day-one checklist to help you set up your service in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
 
-Each search service is managed as a standalone resource. Your role assignment determines what operations are exposed in the Azure portal.
+After you create a search service, we recommend that you:
 
-## Portal and administrator permissions
+> [!div class="checklist"]
+>
+> + [Configure role-based access](#configure-role-based-access)
+> + [Configure a managed identity](#configure-a-managed-identity)
+> + [Configure network security](#configure-network-security)
+> + [Check capacity and understand billing](#check-capacity-and-understand-billing)
+> + [Enable diagnostic logging](#enable-diagnostic-logging)
+> + [Provide connection information to developers](#provide-connection-information-to-developers)
 
-Portal access is through [role assignments](search-security-rbac.md). By default, all search services start with at least one Service Administrator or Owner. Service administrators, co-administrators, and owners have permission to create other administrators and other role assignments. They have full access to all portal pages and operations on a default search service.
+## Configure role-based access
 
-If you disable API keys on a search service and use roles only, administrators must grant themselves data plane role assignments for full access to objects and data. These role assignments include Search Service Contributor, Search Index Data Contributor, and Search Index Data Reader.
+Portal access is based on [role assignments](search-security-rbac.md). By default, new search services have at least one service administrator or owner. Service administrators, co-administrators, and owners have permission to create more administrators and assign other roles. They also have access to all portal pages and operations on default search services.
 
 > [!TIP]
-> By default, any owner or administrator can create or delete services. To prevent accidental deletions, you can [lock resources](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources).

+Each search service comes with [API keys](search-security-api-keys.md) and uses key-based authentication by default. However, we recommend using Microsoft Entra ID and role-based access control (RBAC) for improved security. RBAC eliminates the need to store and pass API keys in plain text.
 
-| Area | Description |
-|------|-------------|
-| 1 | A command bar at the top of the page includes [Import data wizard](search-get-started-portal.md) and [Search explorer](search-explorer.md), used for prototyping and exploration. |
-| 2 | The **Essentials** section lists service properties, such as the service endpoint, service tier, and replica and partition counts. |
-| 3 | Tabbed pages in the center provide quick access to usage statistics and service health metrics. |
-| 4 | Navigation links to existing indexes, indexers, data sources, and skillsets. |
+When you switch from key-based authentication to keyless authentication, service administrators must assign themselves data plane roles for full access to objects and data. These roles include Search Service Contributor, Search Index Data Contributor, and Search Index Data Reader.
 
-You can't change the search service name, subscription, resource group, region (location), or tier. Switching tiers requires creating a new service or filing a support ticket to request a tier upgrade, which is only supported for Basic and higher.
+To configure role-based access:
 
-## Day-one management checklist
+1. [Enable roles](search-security-enable-roles.md) on your search service. We recommend using both API keys and roles.
 
-On a new search service, we recommend these configuration tasks.

 # Configure customer-managed keys for data encryption in Azure AI Search
 
-Azure AI Search automatically encrypts data at rest with [service-managed keys](/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest#azure-encryption-at-rest-components). If more protection is needed, you can supplement default encryption with another encryption layer using keys that you create and manage in Azure Key Vault. 
+Azure AI Search automatically encrypts data at rest with [Microsoft-managed keys](/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest#azure-encryption-at-rest-components). If you need another layer of encryption or the ability to revoke keys and shut down access to content, you can use keys that you create and manage in Azure Key Vault. This article explains how to set up customer-managed key (CMK) encryption.
 
-This article walks you through the steps of setting up customer-managed key (CMK) or "bring-your-own-key" (BYOK) encryption.
+You can store keys using either Azure Key Vault or Azure Key Vault Managed HSM (Hardware Security Module). An Azure Key Vault Managed HSM is an FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSM. HSM support is new in Azure AI Search. To migrate to HSM, [rotate your keys](#rotate-or-update-encryption-keys) and choose Managed HSM for storage.
 
-> [!NOTE]
-> If an index is CMK encrypted, it's only accessible if the search service has access to the key. If access is revoked, the index is unusable and the service cannot be scaled until the index is deleted or access to the key is restored.
+> [!IMPORTANT]
+> CMK encryption is irreversible. You can rotate keys and change CMK configuration, but index encryption lasts for the lifetime of the index. Post-CMK encryption, an index is only accessible if the search service has access to the key. If you revoke access to the key by deleting or changing role assignment, the index is unusable and the service can't be scaled until the index is deleted or access to the key is restored. If you delete or rotate keys, the most recent key is cached for up to 60 minutes.
 
 ## CMK encrypted objects
 
-CMK encryption is applied to individual objects. If you require CMK across your search service, [set an enforcement policy](#set-up-a-policy-to-enforce-cmk-compliance).
-
-CMK encryption is applied when an object is created, which means you can't encrypt objects that already exist. CMK encryption occurs each time an object is saved to disk, for both data at rest (long-term storage) or temporary cached data (short-term storage). With CMK, the disk never sees unencrypted data.
+CMK encryption applies to individual objects when they're created. This means you can't encrypt objects that already exist. CMK encryption occurs each time an object is saved to disk, for both data at rest (long-term storage) or temporary cached data (short-term storage). With CMK, the disk never sees unencrypted data.
 
 Objects that can be encrypted include indexes, synonym lists, indexers, data sources, and skillsets. Encryption is computationally expensive to decrypt so only sensitive content is encrypted.
 
 Encryption is performed over the following content:
 
 + All content within indexes and synonym lists.
 
-+ Sensitive content in indexers, data sources, skillsets, and vectorizers. This content consists of only those fields that store connection strings, descriptions, identities, keys, and user inputs. For example, skillsets have Azure AI services keys, and some skills accept user inputs, such as custom entities. In both cases, keys and user inputs into skills are encrypted. Any references to external resources (such as Azure data sources or Azure OpenAI models) are also encrypted.
-
-## Full double encryption
-
-When you introduce CMK encryption, you're encrypting content twice. For the objects and fields noted in the previous section, content is first encrypted with your CMK, and secondly with the Microsoft-managed key. Content is doubly encrypted on data disks for long-term storage, and on temporary disks used for short-term storage.
-
-Enabling CMK encryption increases index size and degrades query performance. Based on observations to date, you can expect to see an increase of 30-60 percent in query times, although actual performance varies depending on the index definition and types of queries. Because performance is diminished, we recommend that you only enable this feature on objects that really require it.
-
-Although double encryption is now available in all regions, support was rolled out in two phases:
-
-+ The first rollout was on August 1, 2020 and included the five regions listed below. Search services created in the following regions supported CMK for data disks, but not temporary disks:
-
-  + West US 2
-  + East US
-  + South Central US
-  + US Gov Virginia
-  + US Gov Arizona
++ Sensitive content in indexers, data sources, skillsets, and vectorizers. Sensitive content refers to connection strings, descriptions, identities, keys, and user inputs. For example, skillsets have Azure AI services keys, and some skills accept user inputs, such as custom entities. In both cases, keys and user inputs are encrypted. Any references to external resources (such as Azure data sources or Azure OpenAI models) are also encrypted.
 
-+ The second rollout on May 13, 2021 added encryption for temporary disks and extended CMK encryption to [all supported regions](search-region-support.md).
-
-  If you're using CMK from a service created during the first rollout and you also want CMK encryption over temporary disks, you need to create a new search service in your region of choice and redeploy your content. To determine your service creation date, see [How to check service creation date](vector-search-index-size.md#how-to-check-service-creation-date).
+If you require CMK across your search service, [set an enforcement policy](#set-up-a-policy-to-enforce-cmk-compliance).
 
 ## Prerequisites
 
-+ [Azure AI Search](search-create-service-portal.md) on a [billable tier](search-sku-tier.md#tier-descriptions) (Basic or above, in any region).
-
-+ [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview) in the same subscription as Azure AI Search. You can [create a key vault using the Azure portal](/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal), [Azure CLI](/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-cli), or [Azure PowerShell](/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-powershell). The key vault must have **soft-delete** and **purge protection** enabled. 
-
-+ A search client that can create an encrypted object, such as a [REST client](search-get-started-rest.md), [Azure PowerShell](search-get-started-powershell.md), or an Azure SDK (Python, .NET, Java, JavaScript). 
-
-## Limitations
-
-+ No support for Azure Key Vault Managed Hardware Security Model (HSM).
-
-+ No cross-subscription support. Azure Key Vault and Azure AI Search must be in the same subscription.
-
-## Key Vault tips
++ [Azure AI Search](search-create-service-portal.md) on a [billable tier](search-sku-tier.md#tier-descriptions) (Basic or higher, in any region).
 
-If you're new to Azure Key Vault, review this quickstart to learn about basic tasks: [Set and retrieve a secret from Azure Key Vault using PowerShell](/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-powershell). 
++ [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview) and a key vault with **soft-delete** and **purge protection** enabled. Or, [Azure Key Vault Managed HSM](/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/overview). This resource can be in any subscription, but it must be in the same tenant as Azure AI Search.
 
-Here are some tips for using Key Vault:
++ Ability to set up permissions for key access and to assign roles. To create keys, you must be **Key Vault Crypto Officer** in Azure Key Vault or **Managed HSM Crypto Officer** in Azure Key Vault Managed HSM.
 
-+ Use as many key vaults as you need. Managed keys can be in different key vaults. A search service can have multiple encrypted objects, each one encrypted with a different customer-managed encryption key, stored in different key vaults.
+  To assign roles, you must be subscription **Owner**, **User Access Administrator**, **Role-based Access Control Administrator**, or be assigned to a custom role with **Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write** permissions.
 
-+ Use the same tenant so that you can retrieve your managed key by connecting through a system or user-managed identity. This behavior requires both services to share the same tenant. For more information about creating a tenant, see [Set up a new tenant](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant).
+## Step 1: Create an encryption key
 
-+ [Enable purge protection](/azure/key-vault/general/soft-delete-overview#purge-protection) and [soft-delete](/azure/key-vault/general/soft-delete-overview). Due to the nature of encryption with customer-managed keys, no one can retrieve your data if your Azure Key Vault key is deleted. To prevent data loss caused by accidental Key Vault key deletions, soft-delete and purge protection must be enabled on the key vault. Soft-delete is enabled by default, so you'll only encounter issues if you purposely disable it. Purge protection isn't enabled by default, but it's required for customer-managed key encryption in Azure AI Search.
+Use either Azure Key Vault or Azure Key Vault Managed HSM to create a key. Azure AI Search encryption supports RSA keys of sizes 2048, 3072 and 4096. For more information about supported key types, see [About keys](/azure/key-vault/keys/about-keys).
 
-+ [Enable logging](/azure/key-vault/general/logging) on the key vault so that you can monitor key usage.
+We recommend reviewing [these tips](#key-vault-tips) before you start.
 
-+ [Enable autorotation of keys](/azure/key-vault/keys/how-to-configure-key-rotation) or follow strict procedures during routine rotation of key vault keys and application secrets and registration. Always update all [encrypted content](search-security-get-encryption-keys.md) to use new secrets and keys before deleting the old ones. If you miss this step, your content can't be decrypted.
+Required operations are **Wrap**, **Unwrap**, **Encrypt**, and **Decrypt**.
 
-## Step 1: Create a key in Key Vault
+### [**Azure Key Vault**](#tab/azure-key-vault)
 
-Skip key generation if you already have a key in Azure Key Vault that you want to use, but collect the key identifier. You need this information when creating an encrypted object.

 ## Step 2: Create a security principal
 
-You have several options for setting up Azure AI Search access to the encryption key at run time. The simplest approach is to retrieve the key using the managed identity of your search service. You can use either a system or user-managed identity. Doing so allows you to omit the steps for application registration and application secrets.

+Use the following instructions to rotate keys or to migrate from Azure Key Vault to the Hardware Security Model (HSM). 
+
+For key rotation, we recommend using the [autorotation capabilities of Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/keys/how-to-configure-key-rotation). If you use autorotation, omit the key version in object definitions. The latest key is used, rather than a specific version.

+
+## Key Vault tips
+
++ If you're new to Azure Key Vault, review this quickstart to learn about basic tasks: [Set and retrieve a secret from Azure Key Vault using PowerShell](/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-powershell). 
+
++ Use as many key vaults as you need. Managed keys can be in different key vaults. A search service can have multiple encrypted objects, each one encrypted with a different customer-managed encryption key, stored in different key vaults.
+
++ Use the same [Azure tenant](/entra/fundamentals/create-new-tenant) so that you can retrieve your managed key through role assignments and by connecting through a system or user-managed identity. For more information about creating a tenant, see [Set up a new tenant](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant).
+
++ [Enable purge protection](/azure/key-vault/general/soft-delete-overview#purge-protection) and [soft-delete](/azure/key-vault/general/soft-delete-overview) on a key vault. Due to the nature of encryption with customer-managed keys, no one can retrieve your data if your Azure Key Vault key is deleted. To prevent data loss caused by accidental Key Vault key deletions, soft-delete and purge protection must be enabled on the key vault. Soft-delete is enabled by default, so you'll only encounter issues if you purposely disable it. Purge protection isn't enabled by default, but it's required for CMK encryption in Azure AI Search.
+
++ [Enable logging](/azure/key-vault/general/logging) on the key vault so that you can monitor key usage.
+
++ [Enable autorotation of keys](/azure/key-vault/keys/how-to-configure-key-rotation) or follow strict procedures during routine rotation of key vault keys and application secrets and registration. Always update all [encrypted content](search-security-get-encryption-keys.md) to use new secrets and keys before deleting the old ones. If you miss this step, your content can't be decrypted.
 
 ## Work with encrypted content
 
-With customer-managed key encryption, you might notice latency for both indexing and queries due to the extra encrypt/decrypt work. Azure AI Search doesn't log encryption activity, but you can monitor key access through key vault logging.

{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Revise Article on Managing Encryption Keys for Azure AI Search"
}
```

### Explanation
The document `search-security-manage-encryption-keys.md` has undergone extensive updates, with 134 additions and 122 deletions resulting in a total of 256 changes. The article now reflects the latest practices for utilizing customer-managed keys (CMK) for encryption in Azure AI Search, addressing improved security and management functionalities.

The title and description were enhanced to clarify the focus on CMK encryption and to establish that Azure AI Search uses Microsoft-managed keys by default, allowing users to implement their own encryption keys via Azure Key Vault for additional security. This update emphasizes the availability of Azure Key Vault Managed HSM as a new capability for users requiring compliance with stricter security standards.

Important notes have been restructured, highlighting that CMK encryption is irreversible and stressing the implications of revoking key access, which can render encrypted indexes unusable. Users are now explicitly warned about the need to manage keys carefully and understand the requirement to rotate or change configurations.

Key sections now detail the prerequisites for using CMK encryption, specifying that a billable tier of Azure AI Search and an Azure Key Vault with certain protections enabled (soft-delete and purge protection) are necessary.

The CMK encryption functionality is clarified further, establishing that it is applied when objects are created and reiterating that existing objects cannot have CMK retroactively applied. The latency implications of using CMK encryption for indexing and querying are described, as well as the operational impact of using Microsoft-managed keys alongside customer-managed keys.

Guidelines for creating encryption keys and configuring permissions through role assignments are refined for better clarity, ensuring users understand how to set up their search services with appropriate access to encryption keys. The process of granting permissions and setting up security principals has been simplified for improved comprehension.

The new policy section elaborates on compliance, emphasizing the importance of setting Azure policies to enforce CMK standards across search services, along with summarizing the dual policy effects of auditing and denying configurations dependent on the use of CMK.

Additionally, key vault tips have been introduced, which provide practical advice for effectively managing keys in Azure Key Vault, enhancing the usability and security of the solutions being built with Azure AI Search.

Overall, these modifications serve to improve the document's clarity, usability, and adherence to current best practices, ensuring users are well-informed about managing encryption keys and ensuring data security in Azure AI Search.

To determine your service creation date, see [How to check service creation date](vector-search-index-size.md#how-to-check-service-creation-date).
 
 Enabling CMK encryption will increase index size and degrade query performance. Based on observations to date, you can expect to see an increase of 30-60 percent in query times, although actual performance will vary depending on the index definition and types of queries. Because of the negative performance impact, we recommend that you only enable this feature on indexes that really require it. For more information, see [Configure customer-managed encryption keys in Azure AI Search](search-security-manage-encryption-keys.md).

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Enhancements to Security Overview for Azure AI Search"
}
```

### Explanation
The document `search-security-overview.md` has been updated to include additional details and clarifications regarding encryption methods in Azure AI Search. The changes encompass 22 additions, 6 deletions, resulting in 28 total updates aimed at enhancing the user's understanding of security features.

This update primarily focuses on the details surrounding server-side encryption, providing a clearer distinction between Microsoft-managed keys and customer-managed keys (CMK). The table related to these encryption methods was expanded to specify that CMK can now also apply to definitions (such as indexers, data sources, skillsets) alongside content (indexes and synonym maps) on both data and temporary disks. Notably, it also clarifies that dually encrypting content occurs with both CMK and Microsoft-managed keys.

Moreover, the explanation surrounding customer-managed keys has been refined. It now emphasizes the dual purpose for using CMK: added protection and the ability to revoke keys to prevent unauthorized access to data. There's a more detailed account of the rollout phases for CMK, outlining the specific regions and services affected by these updates, which enhances clarity for users who may be considering CMK for their data encryption needs.

Additionally, the potential impact on performance due to enabling CMK encryption is discussed more thoroughly, providing users with practical insights into the trade-offs involved in implementing this feature.

Overall, these modifications contribute to a more comprehensive and user-friendly overview of security options in Azure AI Search, ensuring readers are well-informed about encryption capabilities and considerations when managing their data security.
