# Insights
This update in the Azure Document Intelligence documentation reflects a meticulous attention to detail, focusing on linguistic precision rather than functional alteration. By replacing "that particular Azure server region" with "that particular Azure region," the documentation aligns more closely with commonly used Azure terminology. This adjustment eliminates potential ambiguity for readers, especially those who might be unfamiliar with the specific terms used within the Azure cloud ecosystem.

Such changes, though seemingly minor, help in standardizing documentation, reducing misunderstandings, and enhancing the user experience, particularly for a global audience. Understanding the regional dependencies is crucial for organizations when implementing disaster recovery strategies, and ensuring that terminology is clear and consistent supports these efforts effectively. This update showcases the ongoing commitment to improving the clarity of instructional content while preserving the technical integrity and practical applicability of the guide.

-When you create a Document Intelligence resource in the Azure portal, you specify a region. From then on, your resource and all of its operations stay associated with that particular Azure server region. It's rare, but not impossible, to encounter a network issue that hits an entire region. If your solution needs to always be available, then you should design it to either fail-over into another region or split the workload between two or more regions. Both approaches require at least two Document Intelligence resources in different regions and the ability to sync custom models and classifiers across regions.

 The Copy API enables this scenario by allowing you to copy custom models and classifiers from one Document Intelligence account or into others, which can exist in any supported geographical region. This guide shows you how to use the Copy REST API with cURL for custom models. You can also use an HTTP request service to issue the requests.

    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Update on Azure Document Intelligence Disaster Recovery Guide"
}
```

### Explanation
The modification involves a minor update to the disaster recovery guide for Document Intelligence within the Azure platform. Specifically, it includes a subtle grammatical adjustment in the wording related to the specification of an Azure region when creating a Document Intelligence resource. The phrase "that particular Azure server region" has been altered to "that particular Azure region," enhancing clarity without changing the intended meaning of the content. 

This change does not affect the overall functionality or guidance provided in the document but aims to improve readability and ensure consistency in terminology. The adjusted text emphasizes the importance of understanding regional dependencies while maintaining best practices for disaster recovery strategies.
