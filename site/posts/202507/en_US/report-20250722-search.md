+[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](../previews/preview-generic.md)]
+
+In this quickstart, you use [agentic retrieval](../../search-agentic-retrieval-concept.md) to create a conversational search experience powered by large language models (LLMs) and your proprietary data. Agentic retrieval breaks down complex user queries into subqueries, runs the subqueries in parallel, and extracts grounding data from documents indexed in Azure AI Search. The output is intended for integration with agentic and custom chat solutions.
+
+Although you can provide your own data, this quickstart uses [sample JSON documents](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-sample-data/tree/main/nasa-e-book/earth-at-night-json) from NASA's Earth at Night e-book. The documents describe general science topics and images of Earth at night as observed from space.
+
+## Prerequisites
+
++ An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
+
++ An [Azure AI Search service](../../search-create-service-portal.md) on the Basic tier or higher with [semantic ranker enabled](../../semantic-how-to-enable-disable.md).
+
++ An [Azure AI Foundry project](/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/create-projects). You get an Azure AI Foundry resource (that you need for model deployments) when you create an Azure AI Foundry project.
+
++ The [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) for keyless authentication with Microsoft Entra ID.
+
+[!INCLUDE [Setup](./agentic-retrieval-setup.md)]
+## Set up
+
+The sample in this quickstart works with the Java Runtime. Install a Java Development Kit such as [Azul Zulu OpenJDK](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk). The [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk) or your preferred JDK should also work.
+
+1. Install [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html). Then run `mvn -v` to confirm successful installation.
+1. Create a new folder `quickstart-agentic-retrieval` to contain the application and open Visual Studio Code in that folder with the following command:
+
+    ```shell
+    mkdir quickstart-agentic-retrieval && cd quickstart-agentic-retrieval
+    ```
+1. Create a new `pom.xml` file in the root of your project, and copy the following code into it:

+[ASSISTANT]: 
+The suburban belts display larger December brightening than urban cores despite higher absolute light levels downtown likely because suburban areas have more seasonal variation in lighting usage, such as increased outdoor and holiday lighting in December
+ Urban cores, being brightly lit throughout the year, show less relative change
+
+
+Regarding Phoenix's nighttime street grid visibility, it is sharply visible from space due to the structured and continuous lighting of the city's streets
+ In contrast, large stretches of interstate highways between Midwestern cities are comparatively dim because highways typically have less intense and less frequent lighting compared to urban street grids

Some of Earth's most spectacular light shows are natural, like the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, in the Northern Hemisphere (aurora australis, or Southern Lights, in the Southern Hemisphere). The auroras are natural electrical phenomena caused by charged particles that race from the Sun toward Earth, inducing chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere and creating the appearance of streamers of reddish or greenish light in the sky, usually near the northern or southern magnetic pole. Other natural lights can indicate danger, like a raging forest fire encroaching on a city, town, or community, or lava spewing from an erupting volcano.\n\nWhatever the source, the ability of humans to monitor nature's light shows at night has practical applications for society. For example, tracking fires during nighttime hours allows for continuous monitoring and enhances our ability to protect humans and other animals, plants, and infrastructure. Combined with other data sources, our ability to observe the light of fires at night allows emergency managers to more efficiently and accurately issue warnings and evacuation orders and allows firefighting efforts to continue through the night. With enough moonlight (e.g., full-Moon phase), it's even possible to track the movement of smoke plumes at night, which can impact air quality, regardless of time of day.\n\nAnother natural source of light at night is emitted from glowing lava flows at the site of active volcanoes. Again, with enough moonlight, these dramatic scenes can be tracked and monitored for both scientific research and public safety.\n\n\n### Figure: The Northern Lights Viewed from Space\n\n**September 17, 2011**\n\nThis photo, taken from the International Space Station on September 17, 2011, shows a spectacular display of the aurora borealis (Northern Lights) as green and reddish light in the night sky above Earth. In the foreground, part of a Soyuz spacecraft is visible, silhouetted against the bright auroral light. The green glow is generated by energetic charged particles from the Sun interacting with Earth's upper atmosphere, exciting oxygen and nitrogen atoms, and producing characteristic colors. The image demonstrates the vividness and grandeur of natural night-time light phenomena as seen from orbit."

The activity was accompanied by 130 earthquakes occurring over three hours that morning. Mount Etna, Europeï¿½s most active volcano, has seen periodic activity on this part of the mountain since 2013. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on the Landsat 8 satellite acquired the main image of Mount Etna on December 28, 2018.\n\nThe inset image highlights the active vent and thermal infrared signature from lava flows, which can be seen near the newly formed fissure on the southeastern side of the volcano. The inset was created with data from OLI and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) on Landsat 8. Ash spewing from the fissure cloaked adjacent villages and delayed aircraft from landing at the nearby Catania airport. Earthquakes occurred in the subsequent days after the initial eruption and displaced hundreds of people from their homes.\n\nFor nighttime images of Mount Etnaï¿½s March 2017 eruption, see pages 48ï¿½51.\n\n---\n\n### Hazards of Volcanic Ash Plumes and Satellite Observation\n\nWith the help of moonlight, satellite instruments can track volcanic ash plumes, which present significant hazards to airplanes in flight. The volcanic ashï¿½composed of tiny pieces of glass and rockï¿½is abrasive to engine turbine blades, and can melt on the blades and other engine parts, causing damage and even engine stalls. This poses a danger to both the planeï¿½s integrity and passenger safety. Volcanic ash also reduces visibility for pilots and can cause etching of windshields, further reducing pilotsï¿½ ability to see. Nightlight images can be combined with thermal images to provide a more complete view of volcanic activity on Earthï¿½s surface.\n\nThe VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB) on polar-orbiting satellites uses faint light sources such as moonlight, airglow (the atmosphereï¿½s self-illumination through chemical reactions), zodiacal light (sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust), and starlight from the Milky Way. Using these dim light sources, the DNB can detect changes in clouds, snow cover, and sea ice:\n\n#### Table: Light Sources Used by VIIRS DNB\n\n| Light Source         | Description                                                                  |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Moonlight            | Reflected sunlight from the Moon, illuminating Earth's surface at night      |\n| Airglow              | Atmospheric self-illumination from chemical reactions                        |\n| Zodiacal Light       | Sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust                                    |\n| Starlight/Milky Way  | Faint illumination provided by stars in the Milky Way                        |\n\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), managed by NOAA, orbit over Earthï¿½s equator and offer uninterrupted observations of North America. High-latitude areas such as Alaska benefit from polar-orbiting satellites like Suomi NPP, which provide overlapping coverage at the poles, enabling more data collection in these regions. During polar darkness (winter months), VIIRS DNB data allow scientists to:\n\n- Observe sea ice formation\n- Monitor snow cover extent at the highest latitudes\n- Detect open water for ship navigation\n\n#### Table: Satellite Coverage Overview\n\n| Satellite Type          | Orbit           | Coverage Area         | Special Utility                              |\n|------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| GOES                   | Geostationary   | Equatorial/North America | Continuous regional monitoring              |\n| Polar-Orbiting (e.g., Suomi NPP) | Polar-orbiting    | Poles/high latitudes      | Overlapping passes; useful during polar night|\n\n---\n\n### Weather Forecasting and Nightlight Data\n\nThe use of nightlight data by weather forecasters is growing as the VIIRS instrument enables observation of clouds at night illuminated by sources such as moonlight and lightning. Scientists use these data to study the nighttime behavior of weather systems, including severe storms, which can develop and strike populous areas at night as well as during the day. Combined with thermal data, visible nightlight data allow the detection of clouds at various heights in the atmosphere, such as dense marine fog. This capability enables weather forecasters to issue marine advisories with higher confidence, leading to greater utility. (See \"Marine Layer Cloudsï¿½California\" on page 56.)\n\nIn this section of the book, you will see how nightlight data are used to observe natureï¿½s spectacular light shows across a wide range of sources.\n\n---\n\n#### Notable Data from Mount Etna Flank Eruption (December 2018)\n\n| Event/Observation                  | Details                                                                    |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Date of Flank Eruption              | December 24, 2018                                                          |\n| Number of Earthquakes               | 130 earthquakes within 3 hours                                              |\n| Image Acquisition                   | December 28, 2018 by Landsat 8 OLI                                         |\n| Location of Eruption                | Southeastern side of Mount Etna                                            |\n| Thermal Imaging Data                | From OLI and TIRS (Landsat 8), highlighting active vent and lava flows     |\n| Impact on Villages/Air Transport    | Ash covered villages; delayed aircraft at Catania airport                  |\n| Displacement                        | Hundreds of residents displaced                                            |\n| Ongoing Seismic Activity            | Earthquakes continued after initial eruption                               |\n\n---\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Earth at Night\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"30\" -->"

The eruption took a dangerous turn on May 3, 2018, when new fissures opened in the residential neighborhood of Leilani Estates. During the summer-long eruptive event, other fissures emerged along the East Rift Zone. Lava from vents along the rift zone flowed downslope, reaching the ocean in several areas, and filling in Kapoho Bay.\n\nA time series of Landsat 8 imagery shows the progression of the lava flows from May 16 to August 13. The night view combines thermal, shortwave infrared, and near-infrared wavelengths to tease out the very hot lava (bright white), cooling lava (red), and lava flows obstructed by clouds (purple).\n\n#### Figure: Location of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii\n\nA globe is shown centered on North America, with a marker placed in the Pacific Ocean indicating the location of Hawaii, to the southwest of the mainland United States.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Earth at Night\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"44\" -->"

+[{"ref_id":0,"content":"## Nature's Light Shows\n\nAt night, with the light of the Sun removed, nature's brilliant glow from Earth's surface becomes visible to the naked eye from space. Some of Earth's most spectacular light shows are natural, like the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, in the Northern Hemisphere (aurora australis, or Southern Lights, in the Southern Hemisphere). The auroras are natural electrical phenomena caused by charged particles that race from the Sun toward Earth, inducing chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere and creating the appearance of streamers of reddish or greenish light in the sky, usually near the northern or southern magnetic pole. Other natural lights can indicate danger, like a raging forest fire encroaching on a city, town, or community, or lava spewing from an erupting volcano.\n\nWhatever the source, the ability of humans to monitor nature's light shows at night has practical applications for society. For example, tracking fires during nighttime hours allows for continuous monitoring and enhances our ability to protect humans and other animals, plants, and infrastructure. Combined with other data sources, our ability to observe the light of fires at night allows emergency managers to more efficiently and accurately issue warnings and evacuation orders and allows firefighting efforts to continue through the night. With enough moonlight (e.g., full-Moon phase), it's even possible to track the movement of smoke plumes at night, which can impact air quality, regardless of time of day.\n\nAnother natural source of light at night is emitted from glowing lava flows at the site of active volcanoes. Again, with enough moonlight, these dramatic scenes can be tracked and monitored for both scientific research and public safety.\n\n\n### Figure: The Northern Lights Viewed from Space\n\n**September 17, 2011**\n\nThis photo, taken from the International Space Station on September 17, 2011, shows a spectacular display of the aurora borealis (Northern Lights) as green and reddish light in the night sky above Earth. In the foreground, part of a Soyuz spacecraft is visible, silhouetted against the bright auroral light. The green glow is generated by energetic charged particles from the Sun interacting with Earth's upper atmosphere, exciting oxygen and nitrogen atoms, and producing characteristic colors. The image demonstrates the vividness and grandeur of natural night-time light phenomena as seen from orbit."},{"ref_id":1,"content":"# Volcanoes\n\n## Figure: Satellite Image of Sicily and Mount Etna Lava, March 16, 2017\n\nThe annotated satellite image below shows the island of Sicily and the surrounding region at night, highlighting city lights and volcanic activity.\n\n**Description:**\n\n- **Date of image:** March 16, 2017\n- **Geographical locations labeled:**\n    - Major cities: Palermo (northwest Sicily), Marsala (western Sicily), Catania (eastern Sicily)\n    - Significant feature: Mount Etna, labeled with an adjacent \"hot lava\" region showing the glow from active lava flows\n    - Surrounding water body: Mediterranean Sea\n    - Island: Malta to the south of Sicily\n- **Other details:** \n    - The image is shown at night, with bright spots indicating city lights.\n    - The position of \"hot lava\" near Mount Etna is distinctly visible as a bright spot different from other city lights, indicating volcanic activity.\n    - A scale bar is included showing a reference length of 50 km.\n    - North direction is indicated with an arrow.\n    - Cloud cover is visible in the southwest part of the image, partially obscuring the view near Marsala and Malta.\n\n**Summary of Features Visualized:**\n\n| Feature          | Description                                           |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cities           | Bright clusters indicating locations: Palermo, Marsala, Catania |\n| Mount Etna       | Marked on the map, located on the eastern side of Sicily, with visible hot lava activity |\n| Malta            | Clearly visible to the south of Sicily               |\n| Water bodies     | Mediterranean Sea labeled                            |\n| Scale & Direction| 50 km scale bar and North indicator                  |\n| Date             | March 16, 2017                                       |\n| Cloud Cover      | Visible in the lower left (southern) part of the image |\n\nThis figure demonstrates the visibility of volcanic activity at Mount Etna from space at night, distinguishing the light from hot lava against the background city lights of Sicily and Malta."},{"ref_id":2,"content":"<!-- PageHeader=\"Volcanoes\" -->\n\n### Nighttime Glow at Mount Etna - Italy\n\nAt about 2:30 a.m. local time on March 16, 2017, the VIIRS DNB on the Suomi NPP satellite captured this nighttime image of lava flowing on Mount Etna in Sicily, Italy.

(See \"Marine Layer Cloudsï¿½California\" on page 56.)\n\nIn this section of the book, you will see how nightlight data are used to observe natureï¿½s spectacular light shows across a wide range of sources.\n\n---\n\n#### Notable Data from Mount Etna Flank Eruption (December 2018)\n\n| Event/Observation                  | Details                                                                    |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Date of Flank Eruption              | December 24, 2018                                                          |\n| Number of Earthquakes               | 130 earthquakes within 3 hours                                              |\n| Image Acquisition                   | December 28, 2018 by Landsat 8 OLI                                         |\n| Location of Eruption                | Southeastern side of Mount Etna                                            |\n| Thermal Imaging Data                | From OLI and TIRS (Landsat 8), highlighting active vent and lava flows     |\n| Impact on Villages/Air Transport    | Ash covered villages; delayed aircraft at Catania airport                  |\n| Displacement                        | Hundreds of residents displaced                                            |\n| Ongoing Seismic Activity            | Earthquakes continued after initial eruption                               |\n\n---\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Earth at Night\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"30\" -->"},{"ref_id":5,"content":"<!-- PageHeader=\"Volcanoes\" -->\n\n## Volcanoes\n\n### The Infrared Glows of Kilauea's Lava Flowsï¿½Hawaii\n\nIn early May 2018, an eruption on Hawaii's Kilauea volcano began to unfold. The eruption took a dangerous turn on May 3, 2018, when new fissures opened in the residential neighborhood of Leilani Estates. During the summer-long eruptive event, other fissures emerged along the East Rift Zone. Lava from vents along the rift zone flowed downslope, reaching the ocean in several areas, and filling in Kapoho Bay.\n\nA time series of Landsat 8 imagery shows the progression of the lava flows from May 16 to August 13. The night view combines thermal, shortwave infrared, and near-infrared wavelengths to tease out the very hot lava (bright white), cooling lava (red), and lava flows obstructed by clouds (purple).\n\n#### Figure: Location of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii\n\nA globe is shown centered on North America, with a marker placed in the Pacific Ocean indicating the location of Hawaii, to the southwest of the mainland United States.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Earth at Night\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"44\" -->"}]
+
+[ASSISTANT]: 
+To find lava at night, you can look for the visible glow of active lava flows from erupting volcanoes, which emit light detectable from space during nighttime
+ For example:
+
+- The active lava flows of Mount Etna in Sicily, Italy, have been clearly observed at night by satellites and astronauts aboard the International Space Station
+ The bright red and orange glow of lava distinguishes it from surrounding city lights (refs 1, 3)
+
+
+- Similarly, the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii emits an infrared glow from its lava flows, which can be captured in nighttime satellite imagery combining thermal and near-infrared wavelengths (ref 5)
+
+
+- Nighttime satellite instruments like the VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB) on the Suomi NPP satellite use faint light sources such as moonlight to detect the glow of lava and volcanic activity even when direct sunlight is absent (refs 2, 4)
+
+
+Therefore, to find lava at night, monitoring nighttime satellite imagery over active volcanic regions is effective, as the glowing lava stands out distinctly against the dark landscape and city lights

+### Create a search index
+
+In Azure AI Search, an index is a structured collection of data. The following code defines an index named `earth_at_night` to contain plain text and vector content. You can use an existing index, but it must meet the criteria for [agentic retrieval workloads](../../search-agentic-retrieval-how-to-index.md). 
+
+```java
+List<SearchField> fields = Arrays.asList(
+    new SearchField("id", SearchFieldDataType.STRING)
+        .setKey(true)
+        .setFilterable(true)
+        .setSortable(true)
+        .setFacetable(true),
+    new SearchField("page_chunk", SearchFieldDataType.STRING)
+        .setSearchable(true)
+        .setFilterable(false)
+        .setSortable(false)
+        .setFacetable(false),
+    new SearchField("page_embedding_text_3_large", SearchFieldDataType.collection(SearchFieldDataType.SINGLE))
+        .setSearchable(true)
+        .setFilterable(false)
+        .setSortable(false)
+        .setFacetable(false)
+        .setVectorSearchDimensions(3072)
+        .setVectorSearchProfileName("hnsw_text_3_large"),
+    new SearchField("page_number", SearchFieldDataType.INT32)
+        .setFilterable(true)
+        .setSortable(true)
+        .setFacetable(true)
+);
+
+// Create vectorizer
+AzureOpenAIVectorizer vectorizer = new AzureOpenAIVectorizer("azure_openai_text_3_large")
+    .setParameters(new AzureOpenAIVectorizerParameters()
+        .setResourceUrl(AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT)
+        .setDeploymentName(AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT)
+        .setModelName(AzureOpenAIModelName.TEXT_EMBEDDING_3_LARGE));
+
+// Create vector search configuration
+VectorSearch vectorSearch = new VectorSearch()
+    .setProfiles(Arrays.asList(
+        new VectorSearchProfile("hnsw_text_3_large", "alg")
+            .setVectorizerName("azure_openai_text_3_large")
+    ))
+    .setAlgorithms(Arrays.asList(
+        new HnswAlgorithmConfiguration("alg")
+    ))
+    .setVectorizers(Arrays.asList(vectorizer));
+
+// Create semantic search configuration
+SemanticSearch semanticSearch = new SemanticSearch()
+    .setDefaultConfigurationName("semantic_config")
+    .setConfigurations(Arrays.asList(
+        new SemanticConfiguration("semantic_config",
+            new SemanticPrioritizedFields()
+                .setContentFields(Arrays.asList(
+                    new SemanticField("page_chunk")
+                ))
+        )
+    ));
+
+// Create the index
+SearchIndex index = new SearchIndex(INDEX_NAME)
+    .setFields(fields)
+    .setVectorSearch(vectorSearch)
+    .setSemanticSearch(semanticSearch);
+
+indexClient.createOrUpdateIndex(index);
+```
+
+The index schema contains fields for document identification and page content, embeddings, and numbers. It also includes configurations for semantic ranking and vector queries, which use the `text-embedding-3-large` model you previously deployed.
+
+### Upload documents to the index
+
+Currently, the `earth_at_night` index is empty. Run the following code to populate the index with JSON documents from [NASA's Earth at Night e-book](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-sample-data/refs/heads/main/nasa-e-book/earth-at-night-json/documents.json). As required by Azure AI Search, each document conforms to the fields and data types defined in the index schema.
+
+```java
+String documentsUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-sample-data/refs/heads/main/nasa-e-book/earth-at-night-json/documents.json";
+        
+try {
+    java.net.http.HttpClient httpClient = java.net.http.HttpClient.newHttpClient();
+    java.net.http.HttpRequest request = java.net.http.HttpRequest.newBuilder()
+        .uri(URI.create(documentsUrl))
+        .build();
+    
+    java.net.http.HttpResponse<String> response = httpClient.send(request, 
+        java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
+    
+    if (response.statusCode() != 200) {
+        throw new IOException("Failed to fetch documents: " + response.statusCode());
+    }
+    
+    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
+    JsonNode jsonArray = mapper.readTree(response.body());
+    
+    List<SearchDocument> documents = new ArrayList<>();
+    for (int i = 0; i < jsonArray.size(); i++) {
+        JsonNode doc = jsonArray.get(i);
+        SearchDocument searchDoc = new SearchDocument();
+        
+        searchDoc.put("id", doc.has("id") ? doc.get("id").asText() : String.valueOf(i + 1));
+        searchDoc.put("page_chunk", doc.has("page_chunk") ? doc.get("page_chunk").asText() : "");
+        
+        // Handle embeddings
+        if (doc.has("page_embedding_text_3_large") && doc.get("page_embedding_text_3_large").isArray()) {
+            List<Double> embeddings = new ArrayList<>();
+            for (JsonNode embedding : doc.get("page_embedding_text_3_large")) {
+                embeddings.add(embedding.asDouble());
+            }
+            searchDoc.put("page_embedding_text_3_large", embeddings);
+        } else {
+            // Fallback embeddings
+            List<Double> fallbackEmbeddings = new ArrayList<>();
+            for (int j = 0; j < 3072; j++) {
+                fallbackEmbeddings.add(0.1);
+            }
+            searchDoc.put("page_embedding_text_3_large", fallbackEmbeddings);
+        }
+        
+        searchDoc.put("page_number", doc.has("page_number") ? doc.get("page_number").asInt() : i + 1);
+        
+        documents.add(searchDoc);
+    }
+    
+    System.out.println("[DONE] Fetched " + documents.size() + " documents from GitHub");
+    return documents;
+    
+}
+```
+
+### Create a knowledge agent
+
+To connect Azure AI Search to your `gpt-4.1-mini` deployment and target the `earth_at_night` index at query time, you need a knowledge agent. The following code defines a knowledge agent named `earth-search-agent` that uses the agent definition to process queries and retrieve relevant documents from the `earth_at_night` index.
+
+To ensure relevant and semantically meaningful responses, `defaultRerankerThreshold` is set to exclude responses with a reranker score of `2.5` or lower.
+
+```java
+ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
+ObjectNode agentDefinition = mapper.createObjectNode();
+agentDefinition.put("name", AGENT_NAME);
+agentDefinition.put("description", "Knowledge agent for Earth at Night e-book content");
+
+ObjectNode model = mapper.createObjectNode();
+model.put("kind", "azureOpenAI");
+ObjectNode azureOpenAIParams = mapper.createObjectNode();
+azureOpenAIParams.put("resourceUri", AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT);
+azureOpenAIParams.put("deploymentId", AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_DEPLOYMENT);
+azureOpenAIParams.put("modelName", AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_MODEL);
+model.set("azureOpenAIParameters", azureOpenAIParams);
+agentDefinition.set("models", mapper.createArrayNode().add(model));
+
+ObjectNode targetIndex = mapper.createObjectNode();
+targetIndex.put("indexName", INDEX_NAME);
+targetIndex.put("defaultRerankerThreshold", 2.5);
+agentDefinition.set("targetIndexes", mapper.createArrayNode().add(targetIndex));
+
+String token = getAccessToken(credential, "https://search.azure.com/.default");
+
+java.net.http.HttpClient httpClient = java.net.http.HttpClient.newHttpClient();
+java.net.http.HttpRequest request = java.net.http.HttpRequest.newBuilder()
+    .uri(URI.create(SEARCH_ENDPOINT + "/agents/" + AGENT_NAME + "?api-version=" + SEARCH_API_VERSION))
+    .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
+    .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + token)
+    .PUT(java.net.http.HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofString(mapper.writeValueAsString(agentDefinition)))
+    .build();
+
+java.net.http.HttpResponse<String> response = httpClient.send(request,
+    java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
+```
+
+### Set up messages
+
+Messages are the input for the retrieval route and contain the conversation history. Each message includes a role that indicates its origin, such as assistant or user, and content in natural language. The LLM you use determines which roles are valid.
+
+A user message represents the query to be processed, while an assistant message guides the knowledge agent on how to respond. During the retrieval process, these messages are sent to an LLM to extract relevant responses from indexed documents.
+
+This assistant message instructs `earth-search-agent` to answer questions about the Earth at night, cite sources using their `ref_id`, and respond with "I don't know" when answers are unavailable.
+
+```java
+List<Map<String, String>> messages = new ArrayList<>();
+
+Map<String, String> systemMessage = new HashMap<>();
+systemMessage.put("role", "system");
+systemMessage.put("content", "A Q&A agent that can answer questions about the Earth at night.\n" +
+    "Sources have a JSON format with a ref_id that must be cited in the answer.\n" +
+    "If you do not have the answer, respond with \"I don't know\".");
+messages.add(systemMessage);
+
+Map<String, String> userMessage = new HashMap<>();
+userMessage.put("role", "user");
+userMessage.put("content", "Why do suburban belts display larger December brightening than urban cores even though absolute light levels are higher downtown? Why is the Phoenix nighttime street grid is so sharply visible from space, whereas large stretches of the interstate between midwestern cities remain comparatively dim?");
+messages.add(userMessage);
+```
+
+### Run the retrieval pipeline
+
+This step runs the retrieval pipeline to extract relevant information from your search index. Based on the messages and parameters on the retrieval request, the LLM:
+1. Analyzes the entire conversation history to determine the underlying information need.
+1. Breaks down the compound user query into focused subqueries.
+1. Runs each subquery simultaneously against text fields and vector embeddings in your index.
+1. Uses semantic ranker to rerank the results of all subqueries.
+1. Merges the results into a single string.
+
+The following code sends a two-part user query to `earth-search-agent`, which deconstructs the query into subqueries, runs the subqueries against both text fields and vector embeddings in the `earth_at_night` index, and ranks and merges the results. The response is then appended to the `messages` list.
+
+```java
+ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
+ObjectNode retrievalRequest = mapper.createObjectNode();
+
+// Convert messages to the correct format expected by the Knowledge agent
+com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ArrayNode agentMessages = mapper.createArrayNode();
+for (Map<String, String> msg : messages) {
+    ObjectNode agentMessage = mapper.createObjectNode();
+    agentMessage.put("role", msg.get("role"));
+    
+    com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ArrayNode content = mapper.createArrayNode();
+    ObjectNode textContent = mapper.createObjectNode();
+    textContent.put("type", "text");
+    textContent.put("text", msg.get("content"));
+    content.add(textContent);
+    agentMessage.set("content", content);
+    
+    agentMessages.add(agentMessage);
+}
+retrievalRequest.set("messages", agentMessages);
+
+com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ArrayNode targetIndexParams = mapper.createArrayNode();
+ObjectNode indexParam = mapper.createObjectNode();
+indexParam.put("indexName", INDEX_NAME);
+indexParam.put("rerankerThreshold", 2.5);
+indexParam.put("maxDocsForReranker", 100);
+indexParam.put("includeReferenceSourceData", true);
+targetIndexParams.add(indexParam);
+retrievalRequest.set("targetIndexParams", targetIndexParams);
+
+String token = getAccessToken(credential, "https://search.azure.com/.default");
+
+java.net.http.HttpClient httpClient = java.net.http.HttpClient.newHttpClient();
+java.net.http.HttpRequest request = java.net.http.HttpRequest.newBuilder()
+    .uri(URI.create(SEARCH_ENDPOINT + "/agents/" + AGENT_NAME + "/retrieve?api-version=" + SEARCH_API_VERSION))
+    .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
+    .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + token)
+    .POST(java.net.http.HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofString(mapper.writeValueAsString(retrievalRequest)))
+    .build();
+
+java.net.http.HttpResponse<String> response = httpClient.send(request,
+    java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
+```
+
+### Review the response, activity, and results
+
+Now you want to display the response, activity, and results of the retrieval pipeline.
+
+Each retrieval response from Azure AI Search includes:
+
++ A unified string that represents grounding data from the search results.
+
++ The query plan.
+
++ Reference data that shows which chunks of the source documents contributed to the unified string.
+
+```java
+ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
+        
+// Log activities
+System.out.println("\nActivities:");
+if (responseJson.has("activity") && responseJson.get("activity").isArray()) {
+    for (JsonNode activity : responseJson.get("activity")) {
+        String activityType = "UnknownActivityRecord";
+        if (activity.has("InputTokens")) {
+            activityType = "KnowledgeAgentModelQueryPlanningActivityRecord";
+        } else if (activity.has("TargetIndex")) {
+            activityType = "KnowledgeAgentSearchActivityRecord";
+        } else if (activity.has("QueryTime")) {
+            activityType = "KnowledgeAgentSemanticRankerActivityRecord";
+        }
+        
+        System.out.println("Activity Type: " + activityType);
+        try {
+            System.out.println(mapper.writerWithDefaultPrettyPrinter().writeValueAsString(activity));
+        } catch (Exception e) {
+            System.out.println(activity.toString());
+        }
+    }
+}
+
+// Log results
+System.out.println("Results");
+if (responseJson.has("references") && responseJson.get("references").isArray()) {
+    for (JsonNode reference : responseJson.get("references")) {
+        String referenceType = "KnowledgeAgentAzureSearchDocReference";
+        
+        System.out.println("Reference Type: " + referenceType);
+        try {
+            System.out.println(mapper.writerWithDefaultPrettyPrinter().writeValueAsString(reference));
+        } catch (Exception e) {
+            System.out.println(reference.toString());
+        }
+    }
+}
+```
+
+The output should include:
+
++ `Response` provides a text string of the most relevant documents (or chunks) in the search index based on the user query. As shown later in this quickstart, you can pass this string to an LLM for answer generation.
+
++ `Activity` tracks the steps that were taken during the retrieval process, including the subqueries generated by your `gpt-4.1-mini` deployment and the tokens used for query planning and execution.
+
++ `Results` lists the documents that contributed to the response, each one identified by their `DocKey`.
+
+### Create the Azure OpenAI client
+
+To extend the retrieval pipeline from answer *extraction* to answer *generation*, set up the Azure OpenAI client to interact with your `gpt-4.1-mini` deployment.
+
+```java
+OpenAIAsyncClient openAIClient = new OpenAIClientBuilder()
+    .endpoint(AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT)
+    .credential(credential)
+    .buildAsyncClient();
+```
+
+### Use the Chat Completions API to generate an answer
+
+One option for answer generation is the Chat Completions API, which passes the conversation history to the LLM for processing.
+
+```java
+List<ChatRequestMessage> chatMessages = new ArrayList<>();
+for (Map<String, String> msg : messages) {
+    String role = msg.get("role");
+    String content = msg.get("content");
+    
+    switch (role) {
+        case "system":
+            chatMessages.add(new ChatRequestSystemMessage(content));
+            break;
+        case "user":
+            chatMessages.add(new ChatRequestUserMessage(content));
+            break;
+        case "assistant":
+            chatMessages.add(new ChatRequestAssistantMessage(content));
+            break;
+    }
+}
+
+ChatCompletionsOptions chatOptions = new ChatCompletionsOptions(chatMessages)
+    .setMaxTokens(1000)
+    .setTemperature(0.7);
+
+ChatCompletions completion = openAIClient.getChatCompletions(AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_DEPLOYMENT, chatOptions).block();
+```
+
+### Continue the conversation
+
+Continue the conversation by sending another user query to `earth-search-agent`. The following code reruns the retrieval pipeline, fetching relevant content from the `earth_at_night` index and appending the response to the `messages` list. However, unlike before, you can now use the Azure OpenAI client to generate an answer based on the retrieved content.
+
+```java
+String followUpQuestion = "How do I find lava at night?";
+System.out.println("[QUESTION] Follow-up question: " + followUpQuestion);
+
+Map<String, String> userMessage = new HashMap<>();
+userMessage.put("role", "user");
+userMessage.put("content", followUpQuestion);
+messages.add(userMessage);
+```
+
+## Clean up resources
+
+When working in your own subscription, it's a good idea to finish a project by determining whether you still need the resources you created. Resources that are left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually, or you can delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.
+
+In the Azure portal, you can find and manage resources by selecting **All resources** or **Resource groups** from the left pane. You can also run the following code to delete the objects you created in this quickstart.
+
+### Delete the knowledge agent
+
+The knowledge agent created in this quickstart was deleted using the following code snippet:
+
+```java
+String token = getAccessToken(credential, "https://search.azure.com/.default");
+            
+java.net.http.HttpClient httpClient = java.net.http.HttpClient.newHttpClient();
+java.net.http.HttpRequest request = java.net.http.HttpRequest.newBuilder()
+    .uri(URI.create(SEARCH_ENDPOINT + "/agents/" + AGENT_NAME + "?api-version=" + SEARCH_API_VERSION))
+    .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + token)
+    .DELETE()
+    .build();
+
+java.net.http.HttpResponse<String> response = httpClient.send(request,
+    java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
+```
+
+### Delete the search index
+
+The search index created in this quickstart was deleted using the following code snippet:

}
```

### Explanation
The document `vector-search-integrated-vectorization-ai-studio.md` has been modified to enhance clarity, correct inaccuracies, and update content regarding the use of embedding models from the Azure AI Foundry model catalog for integrated vectorization.

Key updates include:
- The `ms.date` field has been updated to July 17, 2025, reflecting the most recent changes to the document.
- The section detailing embedding models has been reformatted for better organization. A new table format has been introduced to categorize supported models under distinct embedding types, including:
  - **Text**: now lists **Cohere-embed-v3-english** and **Cohere-embed-v3-multilingual**.
  - **Image**: includes models like **Facebook-DinoV2-Image-Embeddings-ViT-Base** and **Facebook-DinoV2-Image-Embeddings-ViT-Giant**.
  - **Text and image (multimodal)**: specifies the newly included **Cohere-embed-v4** model, accompanied by a clarification that it can currently only be specified programmatically through specific Azure services, not via the Azure portal.
- The subsequent details about deploying embedding models have been improved for consistency and clarity:
  - The sentence regarding the integration of the Cohere embedding models has been generalized to better reflect all embedding models available, rather than limited to text embeddings only.
  - Repetitive mention of specific models has been consolidated to maintain a cleaner narrative.
- Several instances of language have been adjusted for correctness and clarity, such as the rephrasing of paths and parameters that need adjustment when integrating the embedding models into users' configurations.
- A reminder that image URIs are not currently supported by this integration remains consistent to guide users adequately.

These enhancements serve to provide users with a clearer understanding of the capabilities and requirements of integrating vectorization within the Azure AI Search environment using models from the Azure AI Foundry model catalog.
