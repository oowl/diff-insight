 # Add scoring profiles to boost search scores
 
 Scoring profiles are used to boost the ranking of matching documents based on criteria. In this article, learn how to specify and assign a scoring profile that boosts a search score based on parameters that you provide. You can create scoring profiles based on:
 
-+ Weighted fields, where boosting is based on a match found in a specific string field. For example, if matches found in a "Subject" field should be more relevant than the same match found in a "Description" field.
++ Weighted string fields, where boosting is based on a match found in a designated field. For example, matches found in a "Subject" field are considered more relevant than the same match found in a "Description" field.
 
-+ Functions for numeric data, including dates, ranges, and geographic coordinates. There's also a Tags function that operates on a field providing an arbitrary collection of strings. You can choose this approach over weighted fields if you want to boost a score based on whether a match is found in a tags field.
++ Functions for numeric fields, including dates and geographic coordinates. Functions for numeric content support boosting on distance (applies to geographic coordinates), freshness (applies to datetime fields), range, and magnitude.
 
-You can add a scoring profile to an index by editing its JSON definition in the Azure portal or programmatically through APIs like [Create or Update Index REST](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update) or equivalent APIs in any Azure SDK.
++ Functions for string collections (tags). A tags function boosts a document's search score if any item in the collection is matched by the query.
+
+You can add a scoring profile to an index by editing its JSON definition in the Azure portal or programmatically through APIs like [Create or Update Index REST](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update) or equivalent index update APIs in any Azure SDK. There's no index rebuild requirements so you can add, modify, or delete a scoring profile with no effect on indexed documents.
 
 ## Prerequisites
 
-You can use any API version or SDK package for scoring profiles in keyword search. For vector and hybrid search, use 2024-05-01-preview and 2024-07-01 REST APIs or Azure SDK packages that provide feature parity. For integration between scoring profiles and semantic ranker, use 2025-05-01-preview and later.
++ A search index with text or numeric (nonvector) fields.
 
 ## Rules for scoring profiles
 
-You must have a new or existing search index with text or numeric fields. 
-
-You can use scoring profiles in [keyword search](search-lucene-query-architecture.md), [vector search](vector-search-overview.md), and [hybrid search](hybrid-search-overview.md). However, scoring profiles only apply to nonvector fields, so make sure your index has text or numeric fields that can be boosted or weighted. 
+You can use scoring profiles in [keyword search](search-lucene-query-architecture.md), [vector search](vector-search-overview.md), [hybrid search](hybrid-search-overview.md), and [semantic search (reranking)](semantic-search-overview.md). However, scoring profiles only apply to nonvector fields, so make sure your index has text or numeric fields that can be boosted or weighted. 
 
 You can have up to 100 scoring profiles within an index (see [service Limits](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md)), but you can only specify one profile at time in any given query.
 
-You can use [semantic ranker](semantic-how-to-query-request.md) with scoring profiles. When multiple ranking or relevance features are in play, semantic ranking is the last step. [How search scoring works](#how-search-scoring-works-in-azure-ai-search) provides an illustration.
+You can use [semantic ranker](semantic-how-to-query-request.md) with scoring profiles.

+A scoring profile is defined in an index schema. It consists of weighted fields, functions, and parameters.
 
-The following definition shows a simple profile named "geo". This example boosts results that have the search term in the hotelName field. It also uses the `distance` function to favor results that are within 10 kilometers of the current location. If someone searches on the term 'inn', and 'inn' happens to be part of the hotel name, documents that include hotels with 'inn' within a 10 KM radius of the current location will appear higher in the search results.

-## How search scoring works in Azure AI Search
-
-Scoring profiles supplement the default scoring algorithm by boosting the scores of matches that meet the profile's criteria. Scoring functions apply to:
-
-+ [Text (keyword) search](search-query-create.md)
-+ [Pure vector queries](vector-search-how-to-query.md)
-+ [Hybrid queries](hybrid-search-how-to-query.md), with text and vector subqueries execute in parallel
+Query parameters, including `scoringParameters`, are described in [Search Documents (REST API)](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/search-post).  
 
-For standalone text queries, scoring profiles identify the maximum 1,000 matches in a [BM25-ranked search](index-similarity-and-scoring.md), and the top 50 are returned in results.
-
-For pure vectors, the query is vector-only, but if the [*k*-matching documents](vector-search-ranking.md) include nonvector fields with human-readable content, a scoring profile can be applied. The scoring profile revises the result set by boosting documents that match criteria in the profile.
-
-For text queries in a hybrid query, scoring profiles identify the maximum 1,000 matches in a BM25-ranked search. However, once those 1,000 results are identified, they're restored to their original BM25 order so that they can be rescored alongside vectors results in the final [Reciprocal Ranking Function (RRF)](hybrid-search-ranking.md) ordering, where the scoring profile (identified as "final document boosting adjustment" in the illustration) is applied to the merged results, along with [vector weighting](vector-search-how-to-query.md#vector-weighting), and [semantic ranking](semantic-search-overview.md) as the last step.

-## Use text-weighted fields
-
-Use text-weighted fields when field context is important and queries include `searchable` string fields. For example, if a query includes the term "airport", you might want "airport" in the Description field to have more weight than in the HotelName. 
-
-Weighted fields are name-value pairs composed of a `searchable` field and a positive number that is used as a multiplier. If the original field score of HotelName is 3, the boosted score for that field becomes 6, contributing to a higher overall score for the parent document itself.

-        }  
-      }  
-    }
-]
-```
-
-## Use functions
-
-Use functions when simple relative weights are insufficient or don't apply, as is the case of distance and freshness, which are calculations over numeric data. You can specify multiple functions per scoring profile. For more information about the EDM data types used in Azure AI Search, see [Supported data types](/rest/api/searchservice/supported-data-types).
-
-| Function | Description | Use cases |
-|-|-|
-| distance  | Boost by proximity or geographic location. This function can only be used with `Edm.GeographyPoint` fields. | Use for "find near me" scenarios. |
-| freshness | Boost by values in a datetime field (`Edm.DateTimeOffset`). [Set boostingDuration](#set-boostingduration-for-freshness-function) to specify a value representing a timespan over which boosting occurs. | Use when you want to boost by newer or older dates. Rank items like calendar events with future dates such that items closer to the present can be ranked higher than items further in the future. One end of the range is fixed to the current time. To boost a range of times in the past, use a positive boostingDuration. To boost a range of times in the future, use a negative boostingDuration. |
-| magnitude | Alter rankings based on the range of values for a numeric field. The value must be an integer or floating-point number. For star ratings of 1 through 4, this would be 1. For margins over 50%, this would be 50. This function can only be used with `Edm.Double` and `Edm.Int` fields. For the magnitude function, you can reverse the range, high to low, if you want the inverse pattern (for example, to boost lower-priced items more than higher-priced items). Given a range of prices from $100 to $1, you would set `boostingRangeStart` at 100 and `boostingRangeEnd` at 1 to boost the lower-priced items. | Use when you want to boost by profit margin, ratings, clickthrough counts, number of downloads, highest price, lowest price, or a count of downloads. When two items are relevant, the item with the higher rating will be displayed first. |
-| tag  | Boost by tags that are common to both search documents and query strings. Tags are provided in a `tagsParameter`. This function can only be used with search fields of type `Edm.String` and `Collection(Edm.String)`. | Use when you have tag fields. If a given tag within the list is itself a comma-delimited list, you can [use a text normalizer](search-normalizers.md) on the field to strip out the commas at query time (map the comma character to a space). This approach will "flatten" the list so that all terms are a single, long string of comma-delimited terms. | 
-
-### Rules for using functions
-
-+ Functions can only be applied to fields that are attributed as `filterable`.
-+ Function type ("freshness", "magnitude", "distance", "tag") must be lower case.
-+ Functions can't include null or empty values.
-+ Functions can only have a single field per function definition. To use magnitude twice in the same profile, provide two definitions magnitude, one for each field.

This function can only be used with search fields of type `Edm.String` and `Collection(Edm.String)`. | Use when you have tag fields. If a given tag within the list is itself a comma-delimited list, you can [use a text normalizer](search-normalizers.md) on the field to strip out the commas at query time (map the comma character to a space).

+
+Magnitude is the computed distance between a field's value (such as a date or location) and a reference point (such as "now" or a target location). It's the input to the scoring function and determines how much boost is applied. 
+
+Freshness and distance scoring are special cases of magnitude-based scoring, where the magnitude is automatically computed from a datetime or geographic field. For intuitive boosting that promotes newer or closer values over older or farther values, use a negative boost value (see the [example](#example-boosting-by-freshness-or-distance) for more details).
+
+### Rules for using functions
+
++ Functions can only be applied to fields that are attributed as `filterable`.
++ Function type ("freshness", "magnitude", "distance", "tag") must be lower case.
++ Functions can't include null or empty values.
++ Functions can only have a single field per function definition. To use magnitude twice in the same profile, provide two definitions magnitude, one for each field.
+
+### Set interpolations
+
+Interpolations set the shape of the slope used for boosting freshness and distance. 
+
+When the boost value is positive, scoring is high to low, and the slope is always decreasing. With negative boosts, the slope is increasing (newer documents get higher scores). The interpolation values determines the curve of the upward or downward slope and how aggressively the boost score changes in response to date or distance changes. The following interpolations can be used:  
 
 | Interpolation | Description |  
 |-|-|  
-|`linear`|For items that are within the max and min range, boosting is applied in a constantly decreasing amount. Linear is the default interpolation for a scoring profile.|  
-|`constant`|For items that are within the start and ending range, a constant boost is applied to the rank results.|  
-|`quadratic`|In comparison to a linear interpolation that has a constantly decreasing boost, Quadratic initially decreases at smaller pace and then as it approaches the end range, it decreases at a much higher interval. This interpolation option isn't allowed in tag scoring functions.|  
-|`logarithmic`|In comparison to a linear interpolation that has a constantly decreasing boost, logarithmic initially decreases at higher pace and then as it approaches the end range, it decreases at a much smaller interval. This interpolation option isn't allowed in tag scoring functions.|  
+|`linear`|For items that are within the max and min range, boosting is applied in a constantly decreasing amount. A negative boost penalizes older documents proportionally. Good for gradual decay in relevance. Linear is the default interpolation for a scoring profile.|  
+|`constant`|For items that are within the start and ending range, a constant boost is applied to the rank results. For freshness and distance, applies the same negative boost to all documents within the range. Use this when you want a flat penalty regardless of age.|  
+|`quadratic`|Quadratic initially decreases at smaller pace and then as it approaches the end range, it decreases at a much higher interval. For negative boosting, it penalizes older documents increasingly more as they age. Use this when you want to strongly favor the most recent documents and sharply demote older ones. This interpolation option isn't allowed in the tag scoring function.|  
+|`logarithmic` |Logarithmic initially decreases at higher pace and then as it approaches the end range, it decreases at a much smaller interval. For negative boosting, it penalizes older documents more sharply at first, then tapers off. Ideal when you want strong preference for very recent content but less sensitivity as documents age.

-## Extended example for vector and hybrid search
+## Example: boosting by freshness or distance
+
+In Azure AI Search, freshness scoring converts date and values into a numeric magnitude—a single number representing how far a document's date is from the current time. The older the date, the larger the magnitude. This leads to a counter-intuitive behavior: more recent documents have smaller magnitudes, which means that positive boosting factors favor older documents unless you explicitly invert the boost direction.
 
-See this [blog post](https://farzzy.hashnode.dev/enhance-azure-ai-search-document-boosting) and [notebook](https://github.com/farzad528/azure-ai-search-python-playground/blob/main/azure-ai-search-document-boosting.ipynb) for a demonstration of using scoring profiles and document boosting in vector and generative AI scenarios.
+This same logic applies to distance boosting, where farther locations yield larger magnitudes.
 
-## Extended example for keyword search
+To boost by freshness or distance, use negative boosting values to prioritize newer dates or closer locations. Inverting the boost direction through a negative boosting factor penalizes larger magnitudes (older dates), effectively boosting more recent ones. For example, assume a boosting function like `b * (1 - x)` (where `x` is the normalized magnitude from 0 to 1) that gives higher scores to smaller magnitudes (that is, newer dates).
 
-The following example shows the schema of an index with two scoring profiles (`boostGenre`, `newAndHighlyRated`). Any query against this index that includes either profile as a query parameter will use the profile to score the result set. 
+The shape of the boost curve (constant, linear, logarithmic, quadratic) affects how aggressively scores change across the range. With a negative factor, the curve’s behavior flips—for example, a quadratic curve tapers off more slowly for older dates, while a logarithmic curve shifts more sharply at the far end.
 
-The `boostGenre` profile uses weighted text fields, boosting matches found in albumTitle, genre, and artistName fields. The fields are boosted 1.5, 5, and 2 respectively. Why is genre boosted so much higher than the others? If search is conducted over data that is somewhat homogeneous (as is the case with 'genre' in the musicstoreindex), you might need a larger variance in the relative weights. For example, in the musicstoreindex, 'rock' appears as both a genre and in identically phrased genre descriptions. If you want genre to outweigh genre description, the genre field will need a much higher relative weight.
+Here's an example scoring profile that demonstrates how to address counter-intuitive freshness scoring using negative boosting and explains how magnitude works in this context.
+
+```json
+
+"scoringProfiles": [
+  {
+    "name": "freshnessBoost",

+      "weights": {

+    ]
+  }
+]
+```
+
++ `"fieldName": "lastUpdated"` is the datetime field used to calculate freshness.
++ `"boost": -2.0` is a negative boosting factor, which inverts the default behavior. Since older dates have larger magnitudes, this penalizes them and boosts newer documents.
++ `"interpolation": "quadratic"` means the boost effect is stronger for documents closer to the current date and tapers off more sharply for older ones.
++ `"boostingDuration": "365D"` defines the time window over which freshness is evaluated.

+# Relevance in Azure AI Search
+
+In a query operation, the relevance of any given result is measured by a ranking algorithm that determines the strength of a match based on how closely the result aligns with the query’s content or characteristics. An algorithm assigns a score, and results are rank ordered by that score, with the most relevant matches returned in the response. 
+
+Ranking occurs whenever the query request includes full text or vector queries. It doesn't occur if the query invokes strict pattern matching, such as a filter-only query or a specialized query form like autocomplete, suggestions, geospatial search, fuzzy search, or regular expression search. A uniform search score of 1.0 indicates the absence of a ranking algorithm.
+
+The query engine in Azure AI Search supports a multi-level approach to ranking search results, where there's a built-in ranking modality for each query type, plus extra ranking capabilities for extended relevance tuning.
+
+## Levels of ranking
+
+This section describes the levels of scoring operations. For an illustration of how they work together, see the [diagram](#diagram-of-ranking-algorithms) in this article. A [comparison of all search score types and ranges](#types-of-search-scores) is also provided in this article.
+
+| Level | Description |
+|-------|-------------|
+| Level&nbsp;1&nbsp;(L1) | Initial search score (`@search.score`). <br>For text queries matching on tokenized strings, results are always initially ranked using the [BM25 ranking algorithm](index-similarity-and-scoring.md). <br>For vector queries, results are ranked using either [Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) or exhaustive K-nearest neighbor (KNN)](vector-search-ranking.md). Image search or multimodal searches are based on vector queries and scored using the L1 vector ranking algorithms. |
+| Fused&nbsp;L1 | Scoring from multiple queries using the [Reciprocal Ranking Fusion (RRF) algorithm](hybrid-search-ranking.md). RRF is used for hybrid queries that include text and vector components. RRF is also used when multiple vector queries execute in parallel. A search score from RRF is reflected in `@search.score` [over a different range](#types-of-search-scores).|
+| Level&nbsp;2&nbsp;(L2) | [Semantic ranking score (`@search.reRankerScore`)](semantic-search-overview.md) applies machine reading comprehension to the textual content retrieved by L1 ranking, rescoring the L1 results to better match the semantic intent of the query. L2 reranks L1 results because doing so saves time and money; it would be prohibitive to use semantic ranking as an L1 ranking system. Semantic ranking is a premium feature that bills for usage of the semantic ranking models. It's optional for text queries and vector queries that contain text, but required for [agentic retrieval (preview)](search-agentic-retrieval-concept.md). Although agentic retrieval sends multiple queries to the query engine, the ranking algorithm for agentic retrieval is the semantic ranker. |
+
+## Custom boosting logic using scoring profiles
+
+[Scoring profiles](index-add-scoring-profiles.md) are an optional feature for boosting scores based on extra user-defined criteria. Criteria can include weighted fields, or functions that boost by freshness, proximity, magnitude, or range. There's no extra charge for using a scoring profile. To use a scoring profile, you define it in an index and then specify it on a query. 
+
+Scoring logic applies to text and numeric nonvector content. You can use scoring profiles with:
+
++ [Text (keyword) search](search-query-create.md)
++ [Pure vector queries](vector-search-how-to-query.md)
++ [Hybrid queries](hybrid-search-how-to-query.md), with text and vector subqueries execute in parallel
++ [Semantically ranked queries](semantic-how-to-query-request.md)
+
+For standalone text queries, scoring profiles identify the top 1,000 matches in a [BM25-ranked search](index-similarity-and-scoring.md), with the top 50 matches returned in the response.
+
+For pure vectors, the query is vector-only, but if the [*k*-matching documents](vector-search-ranking.md) include nonvector fields with human-readable content, a scoring profile is applied to nonvector fields in `k` documents. 
+
+For the text component of a hybrid query, scoring profiles identify the top 1,000 matches in a BM25-ranked search. However, once those 1,000 results are identified, they're restored to their original BM25 order so that they can be rescored alongside vectors results in the final [Reciprocal Ranking Function (RRF)](hybrid-search-ranking.md) ordering, where the scoring profile (identified as "final document boosting adjustment" in the illustration) is applied to the merged results, along with [vector weighting](vector-search-how-to-query.md#vector-weighting), and [semantic ranking](semantic-search-overview.md) as the last step.
+
+For semantically ranked queries (not shown in the diagram), assuming you use the latest preview REST API or a preview Azure SDK package, scoring profiles can be applied over an L2 ranked result set, generating a new `@search.rerankerBoostedScore` that determines the final ranking.
+
+## Types of search scores
+
+Scored results are indicated for each match in the query response. This table lists all of the search scores with an associated range. Range varies by algorithm.
+
+| Score | Range | Algorithm|
+|-------|-------|-------------|
+| `@search.score` | 0 through unlimited | [BM25 ranking algorithm](index-similarity-and-scoring.md#scores-in-a-text-results) for text search |
+| `@search.score` | 0.333 - 1.00 | [HNSW or exhaustive KNN algorithm](vector-search-ranking.md#scores-in-a-vector-search-results) for vector search |
+| `@search.score` | 0 through an upper limit determined by the number of queries | [RRF algorithm](hybrid-search-ranking.md#scores-in-a-hybrid-search-results) |
+| `@search.rerankerScore` | 0.00 - 4.00 | [Semantic ranking algorithm](semantic-search-overview.md#how-results-are-scored) for L2 ranking |
+| `@search.rerankerScoreBoosted` | 0 through unlimited  | [Semantic ranking with scoring profile boosting](semantic-how-to-enable-scoring-profiles.md) (scores can be significantly higher than 4) |
+
+## Diagram of ranking algorithms
+
+The following diagram illustrates how the ranking algorithms work together.
+
+:::image type="content" source="media/scoring-profiles/scoring-over-ranked-results.png" alt-text="Diagram showing which fields have a scoring profile and when ranking occurs.":::
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> This workflow diagram currently omits `@search.rerankerScoreBoosted` and a step for semantic ranking with boosting from a scoring profile. If you use semantic ranking with scoring profile, the scoring profile is applied after L2 ranking, and the final score is based on `@search.rerankerScoreBoosted`.
+
+## Example query inclusive of all ranking algorithms
+
+A query that generates the previous workflow might look like the following example. This hybrid semantic query is scored using RRF (based on L1 scores for text and vectors), and semantic ranking.
+
+```http

 # Use scoring profiles with semantic ranker in Azure AI Search
 
 [!INCLUDE [Feature preview](./includes/previews/preview-generic.md)]
 
-Integrating [scoring profiles](index-add-scoring-profiles.md) with [semantic ranker](semantic-search-overview.md) is supported in newer Azure AI Search API versions and Azure SDK packages. Semantic ranker adds a new field, `@search.rerankerBoostedScore`, to help you maintain consistent relevance and greater control over final ranking outcomes in your search pipeline.
+Using a [scoring profile](index-add-scoring-profiles.md) with [semantic ranker](semantic-search-overview.md) is supported in newer Azure AI Search preview REST API versions and Azure SDK preview packages. With this feature, the scoring profile is processed last. Without this feature, semantic ranking is processed last.
 
-Before this integration, scoring profiles only influenced the initial L1 ranking phase of [BM25-ranked](index-similarity-and-scoring.md) and [RRF-ranked](hybrid-search-ranking.md) search results. However, once the semantic L2 ranker re-ranked the results, those boosts no longer had any effect. The semantic reranking process ignored scoring profiles entirely.
+To ensure the scoring profile provides the determining score, the semantic ranker adds a new response field, `@search.rerankerBoostedScore`, that applies scoring profile logic on semantically ranked results. In search results that include `@search.score` from level 1 ranking, `@search.rerankerScore` from semantic ranker, and `@search.reRankerBoostedScore`, results are sorted by `@search.reRankerBoostedScore`.
 
-Integrating scoring profiles with semantic ranker addresses this behavior by applying scoring profiles to L2-ranked results, ensuring that the boosts are taken into account.
+> [!NOTE]
+> If you're using a stable API version or an earlier preview, scoring profiles are only used upstream, before the semantic ranking step. For a diagram of the scoring workflow, see [Relevance in Azure AI Search](search-relevance-overview.md).
 
 ## Prerequisites
 
 - [Azure AI Search](search-create-service-portal.md), Basic pricing tier or higher, with [semantic ranker enabled](semantic-how-to-enable-disable.md).
 
-- REST API version `2025-05-01-preview` or a prerelease Azure SDK package that provides the new APIs. For all preview features, we recommend reviewing the Azure SDK change logs for feature availability: [Python SDK change log](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/CHANGELOG.md), [.NET SDK change log](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/CHANGELOG.md), [Java SDK change log](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/CHANGELOG.md), [JavaScript SDK change log](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/search/search-documents/CHANGELOG.md).
+- [REST API version `2025-05-01-preview`](/rest/api/searchservice/operation-groups?view=rest-searchservice-2025-05-01-preview&preserve-view=true) or a preview Azure SDK package that provides the new APIs.
+
+- A search index with a semantic configuration that specifies `"rankingOrder": "boostedReRankerScore"` and a scoring profile that specifies [functions](index-add-scoring-profiles.md#use-functions).
+
+- A semantic query includes the scoring profile.
+
+> [!TIP]
+> For all preview features, we recommend reviewing the Azure SDK change logs to check for feature availability: [Python SDK change log](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/CHANGELOG.md), [.NET SDK change log](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/CHANGELOG.md), [Java SDK change log](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/CHANGELOG.md), [JavaScript SDK change log](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/search/search-documents/CHANGELOG.md).
+
+## Limitations
+
+Boosting of semantically ranked results applies to scoring profile functions only. There's no boosting if the scoring profile consists only of weighted text fields.
 
 ## How does semantic configuration with scoring profiles work?
 
 When you execute a semantic query associated with a scoring profile, a third search score, `@search.rerankerBoostedScore` value, is generated for every document in your search results. This boosted score, calculated by applying the scoring profile to the existing reranker score, doesn't have a guaranteed range (0–4) like a normal reranker score, and scores can be significantly higher than 4.
 
-Starting in API version `2025-05-01-preview`, semantic results are sorted by `@search.rerankerBoostedScore` by default. If the `rankingOrder` property isn't specified, then `boostedReRankerScore` is the default value in the semantic configuration.

For example, if you boosted based on freshness, then semantic reordering replaces that boost with its own logic of what is most relevant.
