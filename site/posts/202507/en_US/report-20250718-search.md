# Insights
This update to the `toc.yml` file reflects a small but important change in the documentation structure, specifically concerning how links are defined in the table of contents. The previous link likely created a navigation issue, perhaps because it didn't link directly to a specific file recognized by the web server or application (often recognizing specific file types). By altering the link to include the `.md` extension, the documentation maintainers are ensuring that users are directed to the intended Markdown document rather than potentially arriving at an error page or incorrect path.

The focus on the "Transparency Note" within the "Responsible AI" section highlights an ongoing effort to maintain clarity and accessibility in AI documentation, spotlighting transparency as a key element of responsible AI practices. This change is particularly relevant in technical documentation where users rely on precise links to access the necessary resources to guide their understanding and implementation of technologies being described.

This kind of update is crucial for providing users a seamless experience when navigating the documentation, especially when the documentation serves as a go-to resource for developers and practitioners in AI. Properly formatted links ensure that knowledge, transparency, and guidelines around AI practices are communicated effectively.
