+# Configure your environment for Azure AI resources and permissions
+
+In this guide, we walk you through configuring your Azure AI resources and permissions for conversational language understanding (CLU) projects. We present two options:
+
+* [**Option 1: Configure an Azure AI Foundry resource**](#option-1-configure-an-azure-ai-foundry-resource). Azure AI Foundry offers a unified environment for building generative AI applications and using Azure AI services. All essential tools are together in one environment for all stages of AI app development.
+
+* [**Option 2: Configure Azure Language and Azure OpenAI resources**](#option-2-configure-azure-language-resource-and-azure-openai-resources). Azure OpenAI allows users to access OpenAI's language models within the Azure platform, providing security, regulatory compliance, and integration with other Azure services.
+
+Completing these setups is essential for fully integrating your environment with Azure AI Services. You only need to perform this setup once—afterward, you have seamless access to advanced, AI-powered conversational language understanding capabilities.

-To train a model, start a training job. Only successfully completed jobs create a model. Training jobs expire after seven days, after this time you will no longer be able to retrieve the job details. If your training job completed successfully and a model was created, it won't be affected by the job expiring. You can only have one training job running at a time, and you can't start other jobs in the same project.

If your training job completed successfully and a model was created, the job doesn't expire. You can only have one training job running at a time, and you can't start other jobs in the same fine tuning task.
 
-The training times can be anywhere from a few seconds when dealing with simple projects, up to a couple of hours when you reach the [maximum limit](../service-limits.md) of utterances.
+> [!NOTE]
+>
+> When using the **Quick Deploy** option, Conversational Language Understanding (CLU) automatically creates an instant training job to set up your CLU intent router using your selected `LLM` deployment.
 
-Model evaluation is triggered automatically after training is completed successfully. The evaluation process starts by using the trained model to run predictions on the utterances in the testing set, and compares the predicted results with the provided labels (which establishes a baseline of truth). <!--The results are returned so you can review the [model’s performance](view-model-evaluation.md).-->

 ## Prerequisites
 
-* A successfully [created project](create-project.md) with a configured Azure blob storage account
-* [Labeled utterances](tag-utterances.md)
+* **An active Azure subscription**. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).
+* **Requisite permissions**. Make sure the person establishing the account and project is assigned as the Azure AI Account Owner role at the subscription level. Alternatively, having either the **Contributor** or **Cognitive Services Contributor** role at the subscription scope also meets this requirement. For more information, *see* [Role based access control (RBAC)](../../../openai/how-to/role-based-access-control.md#cognitive-services-contributor)
+* **A project created in the Azure AI Foundry**. For more information, *see* [Create an AI Foundry project](../../../../ai-foundry/how-to/create-projects.md)
+* [**Your labeled utterances**](tag-utterances.md) tagged for your fine tuning task.

-[!INCLUDE [Balance training data](../includes/balance-training-data.md)]
+## Balance training data
+
+When it comes to training data, try to keep your schema well-balanced. Including large quantities of one intent and few of another results in a model with bias towards particular intents.
+
+To address this scenario, you might need to down sample your training set. Or you might need to add to it. To down sample, you can:
 
+* Get rid of a certain percentage of the training data randomly.
+* Analyze the dataset and remove overrepresented duplicate entries, which is a more systematic manner.
 
+To add to the training set, in Language Studio, on the **Data labeling** tab, select **Suggest utterances**. Conversational Language Understanding sends a call to [Azure OpenAI](../../../openai/overview.md) to generate similar utterances.
+
+:::image type="content" source="../media/suggest-utterances.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an utterance suggestion in Language Studio." lightbox="../media/suggest-utterances.png":::
+
+You should also look for unintentional patterns in the training set. For example, look to see if the training set for a particular intent is all lowercase or starts with a particular phrase. In such cases, the model you train might learn these unintended biases in the training set instead of being able to generalize.
+
+We recommend that you introduce casing and punctuation diversity in the training set. If your model is expected to handle variations, be sure to have a training set that also reflects that diversity. For example, include some utterances in proper casing and some in all lowercase.
 
 ## Data splitting
 
 Before you start the training process, labeled utterances in your project are divided into a training set and a testing set. Each one of them serves a different function.
-The **training set** is used in training the model, this is the set from which the model learns the labeled utterances. 
-The **testing set** is a blind set that isn't introduced to the model during training but only during evaluation. 
+The **training set** is used in training the model, the set from which the model learns the labeled utterances.
+The **testing set** is a blind set that isn't introduced to the model during training but only during evaluation.
 
-After the model is trained successfully, the model can be used to make predictions from the utterances in the testing set. These predictions are used to calculate [evaluation metrics](../concepts/evaluation-metrics.md). 
-It is recommended to make sure that all your intents and entities are adequately represented in both the training and testing set.

+We recommend that you make sure that all your intents and entities are adequately represented in both the training and testing set.
 
 Conversational language understanding supports two methods for data splitting:
 
-* **Automatically splitting the testing set from training data**: The system will split your tagged data between the training and testing sets, according to the percentages you choose. The recommended percentage split is 80% for training and 20% for testing.

 ## Training modes
 
-CLU supports two modes for training your models
+Conversational Language Understanding (CLU) supports two modes for training your models
 
-* **Standard training** uses fast machine learning algorithms to train your models relatively quickly. This is currently only available for **English** and is disabled for any project that doesn't use English (US), or English (UK) as its primary language. This training option is free of charge. Standard training allows you to add utterances and test them quickly at no cost. The evaluation scores shown should guide you on where to make changes in your project and add more utterances. Once you’ve iterated a few times and made incremental improvements, you can consider using advanced training to train another version of your model.

While standard training is best for testing and updating your model quickly, you should see better model quality when using advanced training. Once you iterate a few times and made incremental improvements, you can consider using advanced training to train another version of your model.
 
-* **Advanced training** uses the latest in machine learning technology to customize models with your data. This is expected to show better performance scores for your models and will enable you to use the [multilingual capabilities](../language-support.md#multi-lingual-option) of CLU as well. Advanced training is priced differently. See the [pricing information](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/language-service) for details.

-Use the evaluation scores to guide your decisions. There might be times where a specific example is predicted incorrectly in advanced training as opposed to when you used standard training mode. However, if the overall evaluation results are better using advanced, then it is recommended to use your final model. If that isn’t the case and you are not looking to use any multilingual capabilities, you can continue to use model trained with standard mode.

+# Configure your environment for Azure AI resources
+
+In this guide, we walk you through configuring your Azure AI resources and permissions for custom question and answering projects, enabling you to fine-tune models with Azure AI Search and Custom Question Answering (CQA). Completing this setup is essential for fully integrating your environment with Azure AI Services. You only need to perform this setup once—afterward, you have seamless access to advanced, AI-powered question answering capabilities.
+
+In addition, we show you how to assign the correct roles and permissions within the Azure portal. These steps help you get started quickly and effectively with Azure AI Language.
+
+## Prerequisites
+
+Before you can set up your resources, you need:
+
+* **An active Azure subscription**. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).
+* **Requisite permissions**. Make sure the person establishing the account and project is assigned as the Azure AI Account Owner role at the subscription level. Alternatively, having either the **Contributor** or **Cognitive Services Contributor** role at the subscription scope also meets this requirement. For more information, *see* [Role based access control (RBAC)](../../../openai/how-to/role-based-access-control.md#cognitive-services-contributor).
+*   An [Azure AI Foundry multi-service resource](../../../multi-service-resource.md) or an [Azure AI Language resource](https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_Azure_PIMCommon=true#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics).
+*   An [Azure AI Search resource](https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_Azure_PIMCommon=true#create/Microsoft.Search) (required for accessing CQA)
