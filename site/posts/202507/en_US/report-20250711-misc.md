# Insights
The recent modifications across multiple documentation files for Microsoft's Document Intelligence services illustrate a clear effort to enhance user guidance and maintain up-to-date documentation reflective of the latest service capabilities. The introduction of an important note in the markdown elements guide emphasizes the intricacies of using the Layout API when dealing with certain document structures classified under figures. This note will assist developers in better understanding how to manage document data extraction appropriately, ensuring they do not mistakenly overlook critical components in their workflows.

Moreover, the updates signify a broader shift within the Document Intelligence services towards supporting both Read and Layout models simultaneously within their container offerings. This unified support is pivotal as it allows developers greater flexibility and capability within a single service framework, without needing to segregate processing tasks across different models. It also suggests an ongoing evolution of Microsoftâ€™s AI services towards more integrated and versatile solutions.

The notable mention of the new features, such as the searchable PDF capability in the Read container, highlights a significant step forward in user-requested functionalities. This enhancement will potentially enable users to extract and search text within PDFs more efficiently, promising improvements in document processing workflows.

Developers should closely follow these updates as they offer not only potential new functionalities to explore but also set the foundation for how applications utilizing these services can be architected more effectively. Keeping abreast of such changes ensures that developers can optimize their usage of the Document Intelligence services, adapting to its evolving capabilities and leveraging new features to their full advantage.
