A new API and portal experience are available to help users find regions where the subscription has quota and the service has capacity to support deployments of a desired model.
 
 We also recommend that customers using commitments now create their deployments before creating or expanding commitments to cover them. This guarantees that capacity is available before creating a commitment and prevents over-purchase of the commitment. To support this, the restriction that prevented deployments from being created larger than their commitments has been removed. This new approach to quota, capacity availability, and commitments matches what is provided under the hourly/reservation model, and the guidance to deploy before purchasing a commitment (or reservation, for the hourly model) is the same for both.

 An Azure OpenAI Deployment is a unit of management for a specific OpenAI Model. A deployment provides customer access to a model for inference and integrates more features like Content Moderation ([See content moderation documentation](content-filter.md)). Global provisioned deployments are available in the same Azure OpenAI resources as all other deployment types but allow you to leverage Azure's global infrastructure to dynamically route traffic to the data center with the best availability for each request. Similarly, data zone provisioned deployments are also available in the same resources as all other deployment types but allow you to leverage Azure's global infrastructure to dynamically route traffic to the data center within the Microsoft specified data zone with the best availability for each request.

### Explanation
此次代码差异的修改主要集中在“Azure OpenAI服务概述”文档中。该文件进行了1行的添加和1行的删除，总共进行了2处更改。

主要更新内容包括：
1. **修改访问方式的描述**：在描述用户如何访问Azure OpenAI服务的部分，原来的表述提到用户可以通过REST API、Python SDK及Azure AI Foundry，现已更新为包括“[Python/C#/JS/Java/Go SDKs](/azure/ai-services/openai/supported-languages)”。这一修改更全面地反映出可用的SDK选项，为用户提供了更明确的访问方式。

通过此次更新，文档的准确性和实用性有所增强，使得用户在获取Azure OpenAI服务的相关信息时能够更便捷地找到适合自己的开发语言和工具。
