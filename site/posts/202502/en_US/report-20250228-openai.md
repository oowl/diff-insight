# Insights

This diff showcases Microsoft's ongoing commitment to refining the Azure AI documentation for enhanced accuracy, usability, and relevance. Here is a closer look at what changed and why:

The updates primarily involve two main areas: refining the metadata to better categorize documents and updating important links to improve user navigation. Transitioning the `ms.topic` from "conceptual" to "reference" across various documents signifies a move to better align the document's purpose with its content—encouraging users to approach the material as a resourceful guide rather than general introductory information. These changes help users quickly identify the nature of the document, whether they are looking for conceptual guides or precise reference material.

The adjustments to hyperlinks, particularly those pointing to the Code of Conduct, highlight an effort to streamline access to critical ethical guidelines. By refining these links, Microsoft ensures that users can swiftly reach and comply with the necessary standards governing application integration with Azure OpenAI. This step not only supports ethical practices but also simplifies the user experience.

The most significant addition within this update is the detailed section on the GPT-4.5 Preview model in the `models.md` file. Introducing this new feature demonstrates an expansion of Azure's capabilities, offering users access to cutting-edge AI technologies. The documentation provides comprehensive details about accessing the model, including registration and eligibility criteria. Moreover, the information on capabilities, such as structured outputs and prompt caching, equips users with the knowledge needed to harness the model's full potential.

Overall, these updates signal a commitment to maintaining informative, streamlined, and user-centric documentation—as Azure continues to adapt and evolve its AI services to meet the needs of its users. Furthermore, the introduction of the GPT-4.5 Preview opens new horizons for users to explore advanced AI functionalities within the Azure platform, setting the stage for innovative applications and solutions. By thoroughly addressing both foundational and cutting-edge aspects of its documentation, Microsoft ensures its users have access to both the practical tools and advanced features necessary for leveraging Azure AI services effectively.

Details on how data is handled can be found on the [Data, Privacy, and Security](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy?context=/azure/ai-services/openai/context/context) page.
+Azure OpenAI Service detects and mitigates instances of recurring content and/or behaviors that suggest use of the service in a manner that might violate the [Code of Conduct](https://aka.ms/AI-CoC). Details on how data is handled can be found on the [Data, Privacy, and Security](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy?context=/azure/ai-services/openai/context/context) page.
 
 ## Components of abuse monitoring
 
 There are several components to abuse monitoring:
 
-- **Content Classification**: Classifier models detect harmful text and/or images in user prompts (inputs) and completions (outputs). The system looks for categories of harms as defined in the [Content Requirements](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/code-of-conduct?context=/azure/ai-services/openai/context/context), and assigns severity levels as described in more detail on the [Content Filtering](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter) page. The content classification signals contribute to pattern detection as described below.  
+- **Content Classification**: Classifier models detect harmful text and/or images in user prompts (inputs) and completions (outputs). The system looks for categories of harms as defined in the [Content Requirements](/legal/ai-code-of-conduct?context=/azure/ai-services/openai/context/context), and assigns severity levels as described in more detail on the [Content Filtering](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter) page. The content classification signals contribute to pattern detection as described below.  
 - **Abuse Pattern Capture**: Azure OpenAI Service’s abuse monitoring system looks at customer usage patterns and employs algorithms and heuristics to detect and score indicators of potential abuse. Detected patterns consider, for example, the frequency and severity at which harmful content is detected (as indicated in content classifier signals) in a customer’s prompts and completions, as well as the intentionality of the behavior. The trends and urgency of the detected pattern will also affect scoring of potential abuse severity.
     For example, a higher volume of harmful content classified as higher severity, or recurring conduct indicating intentionality (such as recurring jailbreak attempts) are both more likely to receive a high score indicating potential abuse. 
 - **Review and Decision**: Prompts and completions that are flagged through content classification and/or identified as part of a potentially abusive pattern of use are subjected to another review process to help confirm the system’s analysis and inform actioning decisions for abuse monitoring. Such review is conducted through two methods: automated review and human review.
