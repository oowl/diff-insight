-1. Feel free to ask any follow-up questions related to the analysis of your video.
-
-
-## Limitations
-
-Below are the known limitations of the video prompt enhancements.
-
-- **Low resolution:** The frames are analyzed using GPT-4 Turbo with Vision's "low resolution" setting, which may affect the accuracy of small object and text recognition in the video.
-- **Video file limits:** Both MP4 and MOV file types are supported. In the Azure AI Foundry portal Playground, videos must be less than 3 minutes long. When you use the API there is no such limitation.
-- **Prompt limits:** Video prompts only contain one video and no images. In Playground, you can clear the session to try with another video or images.
-- **Limited frame selection:** Currently the system selects 20 frames from the entire video, which might not capture all critical moments or details. Frame selection can either be evenly spread through the video or focused by a specific Video Retrieval query, depending on the prompt.
-- **Language support:** Currently, the system primarily supports English for grounding with transcripts. Transcripts don't provide accurate information on lyrics from songs.
-

-
-
-## View and export code
-
-At any point in the chat session, you can enable the **Show raw JSON** switch at the top of the chat window to see the conversation formatted as JSON. Heres' what it looks like at the beginning of the quickstart chat session:
-
-```json
-[
-	{

This deletion encompasses 167 lines of content, which included introductory material, prerequisites, detailed steps for deploying a vision-enabled chat model, and limitations of the functionalities offered.

Previously, the guide provided step-by-step instructions for users on how to utilize vision-enabled chat functionalities within the Azure AI Foundry portal, utilizing features such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and video prompts. It also outlined prerequisites such as the need for an Azure subscription and how to prepare images for the chat model.

By removing this document, users looking for guidance on building and deploying multimodal vision-enabled chat applications will no longer have access to these instructional resources in this format. This change could significantly affect those who were relying on this quickstart for implementing such features and may require users to seek alternative resources or documentation for similar content.
