summary: The recent update to the Azure OpenAI documentation includes new features,
  a significant breaking change, and various refinements aimed at improving clarity
  and accuracy. New FAQs have been added to assist users with language-specific prompts
  and troubleshooting for guest account access. However, the removal of the document
  detailing the integration of Azure OpenAI with Azure Machine Learning represents
  a major shift, indicating possible revisions or changes in direction. Additionally,
  the list of supported data sources has been updated, focusing on Pinecone and Elasticsearch
  while removing reference to the Azure Machine Learning index. These changes are
  part of a broader effort by Microsoft to enhance user experience and ensure that
  documentation remains relevant and helpful. Users are encouraged to stay informed
  about these updates and adjust their workflows accordingly.

# Highlights
The code diff introduces several updates across different documents related to Azure OpenAI. It primarily includes new features, a breaking change, and other documentation updates for clarity and accuracy.

## New features
- Addition of new FAQs regarding the use of Azure OpenAI, providing clarity on language-specific prompts and troubleshooting for access issues with guest accounts.
- Updates to clarify model behavior when users notice discrepancies in response generation.

## Breaking changes
- Complete removal of the "Azure OpenAI on your Azure Machine Learning index data Python & REST API reference" document, which served as a crucial resource for configuring and utilizing Azure OpenAI services with Azure Machine Learning.

## Other updates
- Refinements made to the list of supported data sources for Azure OpenAI, removing Azure Machine Learning index (preview) from the documentation and TOC, focusing on Pinecone and Elasticsearch as the primary options.
- Edits for improved readability and comprehension in existing FAQ content, aligning terminology across the documentation.

# Insights
The recent updates to the Azure OpenAI documentation reflect a concerted effort to refine the information provided to users, helping them to better understand service functionalities and resolve potential issues. The integration of new FAQs enhances the user experience by answering common queries related to GPT-4â€™s operations and language-specific prompt crafting. This represents a proactive step by Microsoft to ensure users gain optimal results when utilizing Azure OpenAI's capabilities.

The deletion of the comprehensive reference document for using Azure OpenAI with Azure Machine Learning highlights a shift in focus, potentially indicating that Microsoft is either revising this integration or directing users towards other solutions. This breaking change emphasizes the importance for users to stay updated with the latest documentation and seek out alternative resources or direct support.

Simultaneously, the housekeeping changes made in the updates to TOC and supported data sources point towards a simplification and streamlining of the Azure OpenAI's integrations, making it clear which data source options are currently prioritized. By maintaining accurate and current documentation, Microsoft ensures that developers can effectively leverage Azure OpenAI services with clear expectations and supported workflows.

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "breaking change",
    "modification_title": "Removal of Azure Machine Learning API Reference Document"
}
```

### Explanation
The code diff indicates a significant change involving the complete removal of the document titled "Azure OpenAI on your Azure Machine Learning index data Python & REST API reference." This document provided comprehensive guidance on using Azure OpenAI with Azure Machine Learning, including detailed instructions on configurable options, authentication methods, and example usage in both Python and REST API formats.

Key aspects of the removed document included:
1. Configuration settings for the Azure Machine Learning index, including required parameters and their descriptions.
2. Various authentication options for accessing Azure OpenAI with Azure Machine Learning, such as access tokens and managed identities.
3. Examples demonstrating how to set up the environment and make calls to Azure OpenAI using both Python code snippets and REST API commands.

The deletion of this document represents a breaking change as it removes critical reference material that users may rely on to effectively use Azure OpenAI services within Azure Machine Learning environments. Users may need to seek alternative resources or guidance in the absence of this documentation.

### Explanation
The code diff reflects a minor update to the document "On Your Data" related to Azure OpenAI. Specifically, it involves modifications to the mentions of supported data sources for the Azure OpenAI service. 

Key changes include:
1. The removal of the mention of "Azure Machine Learning index (preview)" from the note about supported data sources. This suggests that while Pinecone and Elasticsearch continue to be highlighted for their support, Azure Machine Learning is no longer indicated as a preview option in this context.
2. The note now only references Pinecone and Elasticsearch as supported preview data sources, streamlining the information for clarity.

These modifications aim to keep the documentation up to date with the current state of Azure OpenAI's integration with various data sources, ensuring users have accurate information on what is supported.

### Explanation
The code diff shows a minor update made to the Table of Contents (TOC) file for Azure OpenAI documentation. The primary change involves the removal of references to the "Data source - Azure Machine Learning index (preview)" from the TOC.

Specific details of the changes include:
1. The entry for "Data source - Azure Machine Learning index (preview)" has been deleted from the list of available data sources. This indicates that the Azure Machine Learning index is no longer featured as a supported data source within this documentation.
2. The remaining entries in the TOC continue to list Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore, Elasticsearch (preview), and Pinecone (preview), suggesting that those resources are still relevant and supported.

This update ensures that the TOC accurately reflects the current state of available documentation, aligning it with recent changes in supported data sources for Azure OpenAI.
