    "modification_title": "Update on ms.date and permissions in Azure Tables documentation"
}
```

### Explanation
The modification made to the document titled "Index data from Azure Table Storage" involves a minor update to the metadata and permissions information. Specifically, the date was changed from "11/20/2024" to "02/18/2025," reflecting a new publication or revision date. Additionally, the permissions language was refined to specify that for Azure roles, the search service managed identity needs to have **Storage Table Data Reader** permissions instead of the previously mentioned **Reader and Data Access** permissions. Consequently, this update helps clarify the required permissions for accessing Azure Storage in the context of using Azure Table Storage with the search service.

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Update on manager and permissions in Azure managed identities documentation"
}
```

### Explanation
The recent changes made to the document on managing identities with Azure Storage included a few minor updates that enhance clarity and accuracy. First, the management author was updated from "nitinme" to "vinodva," reflecting a change in the person overseeing the documentation. Additionally, the publication date was modified from "01/16/2025" to "02/18/2025."

Most notably, there is a revision in the permissions requirements for Table indexing when using an indexer. The previous mention of **Reader and Data Access** permissions has been updated to specify **Storage Table Data Reader** permissions. This change aligns the documentâ€™s content with the current best practices for securing managed identities in Azure. Furthermore, the permission requirements for writing to an enrichment cache now also include the **Storage Table Data Reader** alongside the **Storage Blob Data Contributor**. Overall, these changes contribute to a more accurate and user-friendly documentation experience.
