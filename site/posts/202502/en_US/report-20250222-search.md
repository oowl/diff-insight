You can have one free search service per Azure subscription. Free search services are intended for short-term evaluation of the product for nonproduction applications. Generally, you can complete all of the quickstarts and most tutorials, except for those featuring semantic ranker (it requires a billable service). Free services that are inactive for an extended period of time can be deleted by Microsoft to make room for other services.

-Alternatively, you can use free credits to try out paid Azure services. With this approach, you can create your search service at **Basic** or higher to get more capacity. Your credit card is never charged unless you explicitly change your settings and ask to be charged. Another approach is to [activate Azure credits in a Visual Studio subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

-Basic and Standard are the most common choices for production workloads, but many customers start with the Free service. Among the billable tiers, key differences are partition size and speed, and limits on the number of objects you can create.

 ## Configure authentication
 
-Unless you're using the Azure portal, programmatic access to your new service requires that you provide the URL endpoint and an authenticated connection. You can use either or both of these options:
+When you create a search service, key-based authentication is the default, but it's not the most secure option. We recommend that you replace it with role-based access.

+After deploying your search service, you can [scale it to meet your needs](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md). Azure AI Search offers two scaling dimensions: *replicas* and *partitions*. Replicas allow your service to handle a higher load of search queries, while partitions allow your service to store and search through more documents.

 ## When to add a second service
 
-Most customers use just one service provisioned at a tier [sufficient for expected load](search-capacity-planning.md). One service can host multiple indexes, subject to the [maximum limits of the tier you select](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#index-limits), with each index isolated from another. In Azure AI Search, requests can only be directed to one index, minimizing the chance of accidental or intentional data retrieval from other indexes in the same service.
+Most customers use a single search service at a tier [sufficient for the expected load](search-capacity-planning.md).

+> In Azure AI Search, you can't separate indexing and querying operations, so don't create multiple services for separate workloads. An index is always queried on the service in which it was created, and you can't copy an index to another service.
 
-+ Globally deployed applications might require search services in each geography to minimize latency.
+A second service isn't required for high availability. You achieve high availability for queries by using two or more replicas in the same service. Because the replicas are updated sequentially, at least one is operational when a service update is rolled out. For more information about uptime, see [Service Level Agreements](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/search/v1_0/).
 
-> [!NOTE]
-> In Azure AI Search, you can't segregate indexing and querying operations; thus, you would never create multiple services for segregated workloads. An index is always queried on the service in which it was created (you can't create an index in one service and copy it to another).

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Update search-create-service-portal documentation"
}
```

### Explanation
This modification pertains to an update made to the `search-create-service-portal.md` file in the Azure AI documentation. The changes include the addition of 114 new lines and the deletion of 100 lines, resulting in a net change that refines and enhances the content throughout the document. 

The primary purpose of this update appears to be to clarify and improve the instructional content regarding the setup of an Azure AI Search resource within the Azure portal. Significant revisions include changes in wording for better readability, the inclusion of visual aids such as images and GIFs to illustrate processes, and more structured sections to enhance user navigation.

Key modifications encompass a shift in focus from a generalized explanation of the service to a more step-by-step guide, integrating clear headers and instructions for users. This revised content aims to make the setup process more intuitive, delineating critical properties and requirements for creating a search service, including the implications of choosing specific pricing tiers and region selections.

Overall, these changes are geared towards improving user experience by offering clearer guidance and support, reducing ambiguity, and enhancing comprehension of the setup process for Azure AI Search services.
