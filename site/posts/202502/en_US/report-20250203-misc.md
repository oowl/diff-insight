# Highlights
The recent update involves a variety of documentation modifications primarily concerning the Azure AI services, with specific focus areas in date adjustments, extensive content removals, and some additions. The changes include amendments to publication dates for future readiness, but more significantly, numerous breaking changes indicate comprehensive removals of critical instructional content related to the Custom Text Analytics for Health and Sentiment Analysis services. These changes suggest a substantial shift in documentation strategy and possibly service offerings.

## New features
- Introduction of a new "Serp Connection Keys" image that enhances documentation.

## Breaking changes
- Extensive removal of guidance documents for Custom Text Analytics for Health, including important topics such as data formats, evaluation metrics, API call instructions, project creation, and overall service overviews.
- Deletion of various instructional images used in Azure AI documentation to facilitate understanding of processes and features, like model deployment and resource setup.

## Other updates
- Updates to the `index.yml` and `toc.yml` configurations for Azure AI documentation that reorganize and streamline content, removing references to certain features.
- Minor date adjustments across several documents to reflect planned release changes.
  
# Insights
This documentation overhaul represents a significant pivot in how Azure AI communicates its services and organizes instructional content, possibly indicating internal restructuring of service offerings or a transition towards more centralized resources. The breaking changes primarily affect Custom Text Analytics for Health and Sentiment Analysis, suggesting either a significant change in these services themselves or a consolidation effort to streamline AI documentation.

The removal of core documentation on these features could reflect upcoming deprecation, push towards alternative tools, or simply a consolidation of knowledge into other formats. The loss of comprehensive guides including API interaction, model training, and deployment instructions will deeply impact users previously reliant on these details for implementation.

Simultaneously, the introduction of visual aids like the new "Serp Connection Keys" image shows an intention to utilize graphics for clearer guidance, which can be especially helpful for visual learners or complex setup procedures.

For current users of these AI services, it is critical to stay informed about potential announcements or new resources that could supplement the removed documentation. Checking for updates on Azure's official channels or support might provide alternative ways to access necessary guidance or transition strategies for affected services.

-|Key  |Placeholder  |Value  | Example |
-|---------|---------|----------|--|
-| `multilingual` | `true`| A boolean value that enables you to have documents in multiple languages in your dataset and when your model is deployed you can query the model in any supported language (not necessarily included in your training documents). See [language support](../language-support.md#) to learn more about multilingual support. | `true`|
-|`projectName`|`{PROJECT-NAME}`|Project name|`myproject`|
-| `storageInputContainerName` |`{CONTAINER-NAME}`|Container name|`mycontainer`|
-| `entities` | | Array containing all the entity types you have in the project. These are the entity types that will be extracted from your documents into.|  |
-| `category` | | The name of the entity type, which can be user defined for new entity definitions, or predefined for prebuilt entities. For more information, see the entity naming rules below.|  |
-|`compositionSetting`|`{COMPOSITION-SETTING}`|Rule that defines how to manage multiple components in your entity. Options are `combineComponents` or `separateComponents`. |`combineComponents`|
-| `list` | | Array containing all the sublists you have in the project for a specific entity. Lists can be added to prebuilt entities or new entities with learned components.|  |
-|`sublists`|`[]`|Array containing sublists. Each sublist is a key and its associated values.|`[]`|
-| `listKey`| `One` | A normalized value for the list of synonyms to map back to in prediction. | `One` |
-|`synonyms`|`[]`|Array containing all the synonyms|synonym|
-| `language` | `{LANGUAGE-CODE}` |  A string specifying the language code for the synonym in your sublist. If your project is a multilingual project and you want to support your list of synonyms for all the languages in your project, you have to explicitly add your synonyms to each language. See [Language support](../language-support.md) for more information about supported language codes. |`en`|
-| `values`| `"EntityNumberone"`, `"FirstEntity"`  | A list of comma separated strings that will be matched exactly for extraction and map to the list key. | `"EntityNumberone"`, `"FirstEntity"` |
-| `prebuilts` | `MedicationName` | The name of the prebuilt component populating the prebuilt entity. [Prebuilt entities](../../text-analytics-for-health/concepts/health-entity-categories.md) are automatically loaded into your project by default but you can extend them with list components in your labels file.  | `MedicationName` |
-| `documents` | | Array containing all the documents in your project and list of the entities labeled within each document. | [] |
-| `location` | `{DOCUMENT-NAME}` |  The location of the documents in the storage container. Since all the documents are in the root of the container this should be the document name.|`doc1.txt`|
-| `dataset` | `{DATASET}` |  The test set to which this file goes to when split before training. Learn more about data splitting [here](../how-to/train-model.md#data-splitting). Possible values for this field are `Train` and `Test`.      |`Train`|
-| `regionOffset` |  |  The inclusive character position of the start of the text.      |`0`|
-| `regionLength` |  |  The length of the bounding box in terms of UTF16 characters. Training only considers the data in this region.      |`500`|
-| `category` |  |  The type of entity associated with the span of text specified. | `Entity1`|
-| `offset` |  |  The start position for the entity text. | `25`|
-| `length` |  |  The length of the entity in terms of UTF16 characters. | `20`|
-| `language` | `{LANGUAGE-CODE}` |  A string specifying the language code for the document used in your project. If your project is a multilingual project, choose the language code of the majority of the documents. See [Language support](../language-support.md) for more information about supported language codes. |`en`|
-
-## Entity naming rules
-
-1. [Prebuilt entity names](../../text-analytics-for-health/concepts/health-entity-categories.md) are predefined. They must be populated with a prebuilt component and it must match the entity name.
-2. New user defined entities (entities with learned components or labeled text) can't use prebuilt entity names.

-# Entity components in custom text analytics for health
-
-In custom Text Analytics for health, entities are relevant pieces of information that are extracted from your unstructured input text. An entity can be extracted by different methods. They can be learned through context, matched from a list, or detected by a prebuilt recognized entity. Every entity in your project is composed of one or more of these methods, which are defined as your entity's components. When an entity is defined by more than one component, their predictions can overlap. You can determine the behavior of an entity prediction when its components overlap by using a fixed set of options in the **Entity options**.
-
-## Component types
-
-An entity component determines a way you can extract the entity. An entity can contain one component, which would determine the only method that would be used to extract the entity, or multiple components to expand the ways in which the entity is defined and extracted. 
-
-The [Text Analytics for health entities](../../text-analytics-for-health/concepts/health-entity-categories.md) are automatically loaded into your project as entities with prebuilt components. You can define list components for entities with prebuilt components but you can't add learned components. Similarly, you can create new entities with learned and list components, but you can't populate them with additional prebuilt components.
-
-### Learned component
-
-The learned component uses the entity tags you label your text with to train a machine learned model. The model learns to predict where the entity is, based on the context within the text. Your labels provide examples of where the entity is expected to be present in text, based on the meaning of the words around it and as the words that were labeled. This component is only defined if you add labels to your data for the entity. If you do not label any data, it will not have a learned component.
-
-The Text Analytics for health entities, which by default have prebuilt components can't be extended with learned components, meaning they do not require or accept further labeling to function.
-
-:::image type="content" source="../media/learned-component.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing an example of learned components for entities." lightbox="../media/learned-component.png":::
-
-### List component
-
-The list component represents a fixed, closed set of related words along with their synonyms. The component performs an exact text match against the list of values you provide as synonyms. Each synonym belongs to a "list key", which can be used as the normalized, standard value for the synonym that will return in the output if the list component is matched. List keys are **not** used for matching.
-
-In multilingual projects, you can specify a different set of synonyms for each language. While using the prediction API, you can specify the language in the input request, which will only match the synonyms associated to that language.
-
-
-:::image type="content" source="../media/list-component.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing an example of list components for entities." lightbox="../media/list-component.png":::
-
-### Prebuilt component
-
-The [Text Analytics for health entities](../../text-analytics-for-health/concepts/health-entity-categories.md) are automatically loaded into your project as entities with prebuilt components. You can define list components for entities with prebuilt components but you cannot add learned components. Similarly, you can create new entities with learned and list components, but you cannot populate them with additional prebuilt components. Entities with prebuilt components are pretrained and can extract information relating to their categories without any labels.
-
-:::image type="content" source="../media/prebuilt-component.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing an example of prebuilt components for entities." lightbox="../media/prebuilt-component.png":::
-
-
-## Entity options
-
-When multiple components are defined for an entity, their predictions may overlap. When an overlap occurs, each entity's final prediction is determined by one of the following options.
-
-### Combine components
-
-Combine components as one entity when they overlap by taking the union of all the components.
-
-Use this to combine all components when they overlap. When components are combined, you get all the extra information that’s tied to a list or prebuilt component when they are present.
-
-#### Example
-
-Suppose you have an entity called Software that has a list component, which contains “Proseware OS” as an entry. In your input data, you have “I want to buy Proseware OS 9” with “Proseware OS 9” tagged as Software:
-
-:::image type="content" source="../media/union-overlap-example-1.svg" alt-text="A screenshot showing a learned and list entity overlapped." lightbox="../media/union-overlap-example-1.svg":::
-
-By using combine components, the entity will return with the full context as “Proseware OS 9” along with the key from the list component:
-
-:::image type="content" source="../media/union-overlap-example-1-part-2.svg" alt-text="A screenshot showing the result of a combined component." lightbox="../media/union-overlap-example-1-part-2.svg":::
-
-Suppose you had the same utterance but only “OS 9” was predicted by the learned component:
-
-:::image type="content" source="../media/union-overlap-example-2.svg" alt-text="A screenshot showing an utterance with O S 9 predicted by the learned component." lightbox="../media/union-overlap-example-2.svg":::
-
-With combine components, the entity will still return as “Proseware OS 9” with the key from the list component:
-
-:::image type="content" source="../media/union-overlap-example-2-part-2.svg" alt-text="A screenshot showing the returned software entity." lightbox="../media/union-overlap-example-2-part-2.svg":::
-
-
-### Don't combine components
-
-Each overlapping component will return as a separate instance of the entity. Apply your own logic after prediction with this option.
-
-#### Example
-
-Suppose you have an entity called Software that has a list component, which contains “Proseware Desktop” as an entry. In your labeled data, you have “I want to buy Proseware Desktop Pro” with “Proseware Desktop Pro” labeled as Software:
-
-:::image type="content" source="../media/separated-overlap-example-1.svg" alt-text="A screenshot showing an example of a learned and list entity overlapped." lightbox="../media/separated-overlap-example-1.svg":::
-
-When you do not combine components, the entity will return twice:
-
-:::image type="content" source="../media/separated-overlap-example-1-part-2.svg" alt-text="A screenshot showing the entity returned twice." lightbox="../media/separated-overlap-example-1-part-2.svg":::
-
-
-## How to use components and options
-
-Components give you the flexibility to define your entity in more than one way. When you combine components, you make sure that each component is represented and you reduce the number of entities returned in your predictions. 
-
-A common practice is to extend a prebuilt component with a list of values that the prebuilt might not support. For example, if you have a **Medication Name** entity, which has a `Medication.Name` prebuilt component added to it, the entity may not predict all the medication names specific to your domain. You can use a list component to extend the values of the Medication Name entity and thereby extending the prebuilt with your own values of Medication Names.
-
-Other times you may be interested in extracting an entity through context such as a **medical device**. You would label for the learned component of the medical device to learn _where_ a medical device is based on its position within the sentence. You may also have a list of medical devices that you already know before hand that you'd like to always extract. Combining both components in one entity allows you to get both options for the entity.
-
-When you do not combine components, you allow every component to act as an independent entity extractor. One way of using this option is to separate the entities extracted from a list to the ones extracted through the learned or prebuilt components to handle and treat them differently.

### Explanation
The document `entity-components.md`, which provided comprehensive insights into how entity components are utilized within the Custom Text Analytics for Health service, has been fully removed. This change represents a significant update, with a deletion of 106 lines that included details on various types of entity components (learned, list, and prebuilt), as well as their behaviors and options for handling overlaps in predictions. The removal could indicate a restructuring of the documentation or a major overhaul in how entity components are defined and used within the service.

-# Evaluation metrics for custom Text Analytics for health models
-
-Your [dataset is split](../how-to/train-model.md#data-splitting) into two parts: a set for training, and a set for testing. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used as a test for model after training to calculate the model performance and evaluation. The testing set is not introduced to the model through the training process, to make sure that the model is tested on new data.
-
-Model evaluation is triggered automatically after training is completed successfully. The evaluation process starts by using the trained model to predict user defined entities for documents in the test set, and compares them with the provided data labels (which establishes a baseline of truth). The results are returned so you can review the model’s performance. User defined entities are **included** in the evaluation factoring in Learned and List components; Text Analytics for health prebuilt entities are **not** factored in the model evaluation. For evaluation, custom Text Analytics for health uses the following metrics:
-
-* **Precision**: Measures how precise/accurate your model is. It is the ratio between the correctly identified positives (true positives) and all identified positives. The precision metric reveals how many of the predicted entities are correctly labeled. 
-
-    `Precision = #True_Positive / (#True_Positive + #False_Positive)`
-
-* **Recall**: Measures the model's ability to predict actual positive classes. It is the ratio between the predicted true positives and what was actually tagged. The recall metric reveals how many of the predicted entities are correct.
-
-    `Recall = #True_Positive / (#True_Positive + #False_Negatives)`
-
-* **F1 score**: The F1 score is a function of Precision and Recall. It's needed when you seek a balance between Precision and Recall.
-
-    `F1 Score = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)` <br> 
-
->[!NOTE]
-> Precision, recall and F1 score are calculated for each entity separately (*entity-level* evaluation) and for the model collectively (*model-level* evaluation).
-
-## Model-level and entity-level evaluation metrics
-
-Precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated for each entity separately (entity-level evaluation) and for the model collectively (model-level evaluation).
-
-The definitions of precision, recall, and evaluation are the same for both entity-level and model-level evaluations. However, the counts for *True Positives*, *False Positives*, and *False Negatives* differ can differ. For example, consider the following text.
-
-### Example
-
-*The first party of this contract is John Smith, resident of 5678 Main Rd., City of Frederick, state of Nebraska. And the second party is Forrest Ray, resident of 123-345 Integer Rd., City of Corona, state of New Mexico. There is also Fannie Thomas resident of 7890 River Road, city of Colorado Springs, State of Colorado.*
-
-The model extracting entities from this text could have the following predictions:
-
-| Entity | Predicted as | Actual type |
-|--|--|--|
-| John Smith | Person | Person |
-| Frederick | Person | City |
-| Forrest | City | Person |
-| Fannie Thomas | Person | Person |
-| Colorado Springs | City | City |
-
-### Entity-level evaluation for the *person* entity 
-
-The model would have the following entity-level evaluation, for the *person* entity:
-
-| Key | Count | Explanation |
-|--|--|--|
-| True Positive | 2 | *John Smith* and *Fannie Thomas* were correctly predicted as *person*. |
-| False Positive | 1 | *Frederick* was incorrectly predicted as *person* while it should have been *city*. |
-| False Negative | 1 | *Forrest* was incorrectly predicted as *city* while it should have been *person*. |
-
-* **Precision**: `#True_Positive / (#True_Positive + #False_Positive)` = `2 / (2 + 1) = 0.67`
-* **Recall**: `#True_Positive / (#True_Positive + #False_Negatives)` = `2 / (2 + 1) = 0.67`
-* **F1 Score**: `2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)` = `(2 * 0.67 * 0.67) / (0.67 + 0.67) = 0.67`
-
-### Entity-level evaluation for the *city* entity
-
-The model would have the following entity-level evaluation, for the *city* entity:
-
-| Key | Count | Explanation |
-|--|--|--|
-| True Positive | 1 | *Colorado Springs* was correctly predicted as *city*. |
-| False Positive | 1 | *Forrest* was incorrectly predicted as *city* while it should have been *person*. |
-| False Negative | 1 | *Frederick* was incorrectly predicted as *person* while it should have been *city*. |
-
-* **Precision** = `#True_Positive / (#True_Positive + #False_Positive)` = `1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5`
-* **Recall** = `#True_Positive / (#True_Positive + #False_Negatives)` = `1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5`
-* **F1 Score** = `2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)` =  `(2 * 0.5 * 0.5) / (0.5 + 0.5) = 0.5`
-
-### Model-level evaluation for the collective model
-
-The model would have the following evaluation for the model in its entirety:
-
-| Key | Count | Explanation |
-|--|--|--|
-| True Positive | 3 | *John Smith* and *Fannie Thomas* were correctly predicted as *person*. *Colorado Springs* was correctly predicted as *city*. This is the sum of true positives for all entities. |
-| False Positive | 2 | *Forrest* was incorrectly predicted as *city* while it should have been *person*. *Frederick* was incorrectly predicted as *person* while it should have been *city*. This is the sum of false positives for all entities. |
-| False Negative | 2 | *Forrest* was incorrectly predicted as *city* while it should have been *person*. *Frederick* was incorrectly predicted as *person* while it should have been *city*. This is the sum of false negatives for all entities. |
-
-* **Precision** = `#True_Positive / (#True_Positive + #False_Positive)` = `3 / (3 + 2) = 0.6`
-* **Recall** = `#True_Positive / (#True_Positive + #False_Negatives)` = `3 / (3 + 2) = 0.6`
-* **F1 Score** = `2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)` =  `(2 * 0.6 * 0.6) / (0.6 + 0.6) = 0.6`
-
-## Interpreting entity-level evaluation metrics
-
-So what does it actually mean to have high precision or high recall for a certain entity?
-
-| Recall | Precision | Interpretation |
-|--|--|--|
-| High | High | This entity is handled well by the model. |
-| Low | High | The model cannot always extract this entity, but when it does it is with high confidence. |
-| High | Low | The model extracts this entity well, however it is with low confidence as it is sometimes extracted as another type. |
-| Low | Low | This entity type is poorly handled by the model, because it is not usually extracted. When it is, it is not with high confidence. |
-
-## Guidance
-
-After you trained your model, you will see some guidance and recommendation on how to improve the model. It's recommended to have a model covering all points in the guidance section.
-
-* Training set has enough data: When an entity type has fewer than 15 labeled instances in the training data, it can lead to lower accuracy due to the model not being adequately trained on these cases. In this case, consider adding more labeled data in the training set. You can check the *data distribution* tab for more guidance.
-
-* All entity types are present in test set: When the testing data lacks labeled instances for an entity type, the model’s test performance may become less comprehensive due to untested scenarios. You can check the *test set data distribution* tab for more guidance.
-
-* Entity types are balanced within training and test sets: When sampling bias causes an inaccurate representation of an entity type’s frequency, it can lead to lower accuracy due to the model expecting that entity type to occur too often or too little. You can check the *data distribution* tab for more guidance.
-
-* Entity types are evenly distributed between training and test sets: When the mix of entity types doesn’t match between training and test sets, it can lead to lower testing accuracy due to the model being trained differently from how it’s being tested. You can check the *data distribution* tab for more guidance.
-
-* Unclear distinction between entity types in training set: When the training data is similar for multiple entity types, it can lead to lower accuracy because the entity types may be frequently misclassified as each other. Review the following entity types and consider merging them if they’re similar. Otherwise, add more examples to better distinguish them from each other. You can check the *confusion matrix* tab for more guidance.
-
-
-## Confusion matrix
-
-A Confusion matrix is an N x N matrix used for model performance evaluation, where N is the number of entities.
-The matrix compares the expected labels with the ones predicted by the model.
-This gives a holistic view of how well the model is performing and what kinds of errors it is making.
-
-You can use the Confusion matrix to identify entities that are too close to each other and often get mistaken (ambiguity). In this case consider merging these entity types together. If that isn't possible, consider adding more tagged examples of both entities to help the model differentiate between them.
-
-The highlighted diagonal in the image below is the correctly predicted entities, where the predicted tag is the same as the actual tag.
-
-:::image type="content" source="../../media/custom/confusion.png" alt-text="A screenshot that shows an example confusion matrix." lightbox="../../media/custom/confusion.png":::
-
-You can calculate the entity-level and model-level evaluation metrics from the confusion matrix:
-
-* The values in the diagonal are the *True Positive* values of each entity.
-* The sum of the values in the entity rows (excluding the diagonal) is the *false positive* of the model.
-* The sum of the values in the entity columns (excluding the diagonal) is the *false Negative* of the model.
-
-Similarly,
-
-* The *true positive* of the model is the sum of *true Positives* for all entities.
-* The *false positive* of the model is the sum of *false positives* for all entities.
-* The *false Negative* of the model is the sum of *false negatives* for all entities.

-# How to create custom Text Analytics for health project
-
-Use this article to learn how to set up the requirements for starting with custom text analytics for health and create a project.
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-Before you start using custom text analytics for health, you need:
-
-* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).
-
-## Create a Language resource 
-
-Before you start using custom text analytics for health, you'll need an Azure AI Language resource. It's recommended to create your Language resource and connect a storage account to it in the Azure portal. Creating a resource in the Azure portal lets you create an Azure storage account at the same time, with all of the required permissions preconfigured. You can also read further in the article to learn how to use a pre-existing resource, and configure it to work with custom text analytics for health.
-
-You also will need an Azure storage account where you will upload your `.txt` documents that will be used to train a model to extract entities.
-
-> [!NOTE]
->  * You need to have an **owner** role assigned on the resource group to create a Language resource.
->  * If you will connect a pre-existing storage account, you should have an owner role assigned to it.
-
-## Create Language resource and connect storage account
-
-You can create a resource in the following ways:
-
-* The Azure portal
-* Language Studio
-* PowerShell
-
-> [!Note]
-> You shouldn't move the storage account to a different resource group or subscription once it's linked with the Language resource.
-
-[!INCLUDE [create a new resource from the Azure portal](../../includes/custom/resource-creation-azure-portal.md)]
-
-[!INCLUDE [create a new resource from Language Studio](../../includes/custom/resource-creation-language-studio.md)]
-
-[!INCLUDE [create a new resource with Azure PowerShell](../../includes/custom/resource-creation-powershell.md)]
-
-
-> [!NOTE]
-> * The process of connecting a storage account to your Language resource is irreversible, it cannot be disconnected later.
-> * You can only connect your language resource to one storage account.
-
-## Using a pre-existing Language resource
-
-[!INCLUDE [use an existing resource](../includes/use-pre-existing-resource.md)]
-
-## Create a custom Text Analytics for health project

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "breaking change",
    "modification_title": "Removal of Project Creation Instructions for Custom Text Analytics for Health"
}
```

### Explanation
The document `create-project.md`, which provided comprehensive instructions on setting up a custom Text Analytics for Health project, has been entirely removed. This significant change involved the deletion of 117 lines that included prerequisites for starting with custom text analytics, the steps to create necessary Azure resources, and instructions for creating and managing a project. Key sections included how to configure an Azure AI Language resource linked with a storage account, as well as guidance on using either Language Studio or REST APIs for project creation and management. The removal of this documentation suggests a potential overhaul or reorganization of the related content. Users can refer to the [blob URL](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/5c1bed979905d9737f8b9af96a6591f1ecffd115/articles%2Fai-services%2Flanguage-service%2Fcustom-text-analytics-for-health%2Fhow-to%2Fcreate-project.md) for additional details regarding this critical update.

-# Deploy a custom text analytics for health model
-
-Once you're satisfied with how your model performs, it's ready to be deployed and used to recognize entities in text. Deploying a model makes it available for use through the [prediction API](https://aka.ms/ct-runtime-swagger).
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-* A successfully [created project](create-project.md) with a configured Azure storage account.
-* Text data that has [been uploaded](design-schema.md#data-preparation) to your storage account.
-* [Labeled data](label-data.md) and a successfully [trained model](train-model.md).
-* Reviewed the [model evaluation details](view-model-evaluation.md) to determine how your model is performing.
-
-For more information, see [project development lifecycle](../overview.md#project-development-lifecycle).
-
-## Deploy model
-
-After you've reviewed your model's performance and decided it can be used in your environment, you need to assign it to a deployment. Assigning the model to a deployment makes it available for use through the [prediction API](https://aka.ms/ct-runtime-swagger). It is recommended to create a deployment named *production* to which you assign the best model you have built so far and use it in your system. You can create another deployment called *staging* to which you can assign the model you're currently working on to be able to test it. You can have a maximum of 10 deployments in your project.

-
-# How to prepare data and define a schema for custom Text Analytics for health
-
-In order to create a custom TA4H model, you will need quality data to train it. This article covers how you should select and prepare your data, along with defining a schema. Defining the schema is the first step in [project development lifecycle](../overview.md#project-development-lifecycle), and it entailing defining the entity types or categories that you need your model to extract from the text at runtime.
-
-## Schema design
-
-Custom Text Analytics for health allows you to extend and customize the Text Analytics for health entity map. The first step of the process is building your schema, which allows you to define the new entity types or categories that you need your model to extract from text in addition to the Text Analytics for health existing entities at runtime.  
-
-* Review documents in your dataset to be familiar with their format and structure.
-
-* Identify the entities you want to extract from the data.
-
-    For example, if you are extracting entities from support emails, you might need to extract "Customer name", "Product name", "Request date", and "Contact information".
-
-* Avoid entity types ambiguity.
-
-    **Ambiguity** happens when entity types you select are similar to each other. The more ambiguous your schema the more labeled data you will need to differentiate between different entity types.
-
-    For example, if you are extracting data from a legal contract, to extract "Name of first party" and "Name of second party" you will need to add more examples to overcome ambiguity since the names of both parties look similar. Avoid ambiguity as it saves time, effort, and yields better results.
-
-* Avoid complex entities. Complex entities can be difficult to pick out precisely from text, consider breaking it down into multiple entities.
-
-    For example, extracting "Address" would be challenging if it's not broken down to smaller entities. There are so many variations of how addresses appear, it would take large number of labeled entities to teach the model to extract an address, as a whole, without breaking it down. However, if you replace "Address" with "Street Name", "PO Box", "City", "State" and "Zip", the model will require fewer labels per entity.
-
-
-## Add entities
-
-To add entities to your project:
-
-1. Move to **Entities** pivot from the top of the page.
-
-2. [Text Analytics for health entities](../../text-analytics-for-health/concepts/health-entity-categories.md) are automatically loaded into your project. To add additional entity categories, select **Add** from the top menu. You will be prompted to type in a name before completing creating the entity.
-
-3. After creating an entity, you'll be routed to the entity details page where you can define the composition settings for this entity.
-
-4. Entities are defined by [entity components](../concepts/entity-components.md): learned, list or prebuilt. Text Analytics for health entities are by default populated with the prebuilt component and cannot have learned components. Your newly defined entities can be populated with the learned component once you add labels for them in your data but cannot be populated with the prebuilt component. 
-
-5. You can add a [list](../concepts/entity-components.md#list-component)  component to any of your entities. 
-
-   
-### Add list component
-
-To add a **list** component, select **Add new list**. You can add multiple lists to each entity.
-
-1. To create a new list, in the *Enter value* text box enter this is the normalized value that will be returned when any of the synonyms values is extracted.
-
-2. For multilingual projects, from the *language* drop-down menu, select the language of the synonyms list and start typing in your synonyms and hit enter after each one. It is recommended to have synonyms lists in multiple languages.
-
-   <!--:::image type="content" source="../media/add-list-component.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing a list component in Language Studio." lightbox="../media/add-list-component.png":::-->
-   
-### Define entity options
-
-Change to the **Entity options** pivot in the entity details page. When multiple components are defined for an entity, their predictions may overlap. When an overlap occurs, each entity's final prediction is determined based on the [entity option](../concepts/entity-components.md#entity-options) you select in this step. Select the one that you want to apply to this entity and select the **Save** button at the top.
-
-   <!--:::image type="content" source="../media/entity-options.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing an entity option in Language Studio." lightbox="../media/entity-options.png":::-->
-
-
-After you create your entities, you can come back and edit them. You can **Edit entity components** or **delete** them by selecting this option from the top menu.
-
-
-## Data selection
-
-The quality of data you train your model with affects model performance greatly.
-
-* Use real-life data that reflects your domain's problem space to effectively train your model. You can use synthetic data to accelerate the initial model training process, but it will likely differ from your real-life data and make your model less effective when used.
-
-* Balance your data distribution as much as possible without deviating far from the distribution in real-life. For example, if you are training your model to extract entities from legal documents that may come in many different formats and languages, you should provide examples that exemplify the diversity as you would expect to see in real life.
-
-* Use diverse data whenever possible to avoid overfitting your model. Less diversity in training data may lead to your model learning spurious correlations that may not exist in real-life data. 
- 
-* Avoid duplicate documents in your data. Duplicate data has a negative effect on the training process, model metrics, and model performance. 
-
-* Consider where your data comes from. If you are collecting data from one person, department, or part of your scenario, you are likely missing diversity that may be important for your model to learn about. 
-
-> [!NOTE]
-> If your documents are in multiple languages, select the **enable multi-lingual** option during [project creation](../quickstart.md) and set the **language** option to the language of the majority of your documents.
-
-## Data preparation
-
-As a prerequisite for creating a project, your training data needs to be uploaded to a blob container in your storage account. You can create and upload training documents from Azure directly, or through using the Azure Storage Explorer tool. Using the Azure Storage Explorer tool allows you to upload more data quickly.  
-
-* [Create and upload documents from Azure](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal#create-a-container)
-* [Create and upload documents using Azure Storage Explorer](/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-blobs)
-
-You can only use `.txt` documents. If your data is in other format, you can use [CLUtils parse command](https://github.com/microsoft/CognitiveServicesLanguageUtilities/blob/main/CustomTextAnalytics.CLUtils/Solution/CogSLanguageUtilities.ViewLayer.CliCommands/Commands/ParseCommand/README.md) to change your document format.
-
-You can upload an annotated dataset, or you can upload an unannotated one and [label your data](../how-to/label-data.md) in Language studio. 
- 
-## Test set
-
-When defining the testing set, make sure to include example documents that are not present in the training set. Defining the testing set is an important step to calculate the [model performance](view-model-evaluation.md#model-details). Also, make sure that the testing set includes documents that represent all entities used in your project.
-
-## Next steps
-
-If you haven't already, create a custom Text Analytics for health project. If it's your first time using custom Text Analytics for health, consider following the [quickstart](../quickstart.md) to create an example project. You can also see the [how-to article](../how-to/create-project.md) for more details on what you need to create a project.

-# Back up and recover your custom Text Analytics for health models
-
-When you create a Language resource, you specify a region for it to be created in. From then on, your resource and all of the operations related to it take place in the specified Azure server region. It's rare, but not impossible, to encounter a network issue that affects an entire region. If your solution needs to always be available, then you should design it to fail over into another region. This requires two Azure AI Language resources in different regions and synchronizing custom models across them. 
-
-If your app or business depends on the use of a custom Text Analytics for health model, we recommend that you create a replica of your project in an additional supported region. If a regional outage occurs, you can then access your model in the other fail-over region where you replicated your project.
-
-Replicating a project means that you export your project metadata and assets, and import them into a new project. This only makes a copy of your project settings and tagged data. You still need to [train](./train-model.md) and [deploy](./deploy-model.md) the models to be available for use with [prediction APIs](https://aka.ms/ct-runtime-swagger).
-
-In this article, you will learn to how to use the export and import APIs to replicate your project from one resource to another existing in different supported geographical regions, guidance on keeping your projects in sync and changes needed to your runtime consumption.
-
-##  Prerequisites
-
-* Two Azure AI Language resources in different Azure regions. [Create your resources](./create-project.md#create-a-language-resource) and connect them to an Azure storage account. It's recommended that you connect each of your Language resources to different storage accounts. Each storage account should be located in the same respective regions that your separate Language resources are in. You can follow the [quickstart](../quickstart.md?pivots=rest-api#create-a-new-azure-ai-language-resource-and-azure-storage-account) to create an additional Language resource and storage account.
-
-
-## Get your resource keys endpoint
-
-Use the following steps to get the keys and endpoint of your primary and secondary resources. These will be used in the following steps.
-
-[!INCLUDE [Get keys and endpoint Azure Portal](../includes/get-keys-endpoint-azure.md)]
-
-> [!TIP]
-> Keep a note of keys and endpoints for both primary and secondary resources as well as the primary and secondary container names. Use these values to replace the following placeholders:
-`{PRIMARY-ENDPOINT}`, `{PRIMARY-RESOURCE-KEY}`, `{PRIMARY-CONTAINER-NAME}`, `{SECONDARY-ENDPOINT}`, `{SECONDARY-RESOURCE-KEY}`, and `{SECONDARY-CONTAINER-NAME}`.
-> Also take note of your project name, your model name and your deployment name. Use these values to replace the following placeholders:  `{PROJECT-NAME}`, `{MODEL-NAME}` and `{DEPLOYMENT-NAME}`.
-
-## Export your primary project assets
-
-Start by exporting the project assets from the project in your primary resource.
-
-### Submit export job
-
-Replace the placeholders in the following request with your `{PRIMARY-ENDPOINT}` and `{PRIMARY-RESOURCE-KEY}` that you obtained in the first step.
-
-[!INCLUDE [Export project assets using the REST API](../includes/rest-api/export-project.md)]
-
-### Get export job status
-
-Replace the placeholders in the following request with your `{PRIMARY-ENDPOINT}` and `{PRIMARY-RESOURCE-KEY}` that you obtained in the first step.
-
-[!INCLUDE [Export project assets using the REST API](../includes/rest-api/get-export-status.md)]
-
-
-Copy the response body as you will use it as the body for the next import job.
-
-## Import to a new project 
-
-Now go ahead and import the exported project assets in your new project in the secondary region so you can replicate it.
-
-### Submit import job
-
-Replace the placeholders in the following request with your `{SECONDARY-ENDPOINT}`, `{SECONDARY-RESOURCE-KEY}`, and `{SECONDARY-CONTAINER-NAME}` that you obtained in the first step.
-
-[!INCLUDE [Import project using the REST API](../includes/rest-api/import-project.md)]
-
-### Get import job status
-
-Replace the placeholders in the following request with your `{SECONDARY-ENDPOINT}` and `{SECONDARY-RESOURCE-KEY}` that you obtained in the first step.
-
-[!INCLUDE [Import project using the REST API](../includes/rest-api/get-import-status.md)]
-
-
-## Train your model
-
-After importing your project, you only have copied the project's assets and metadata and assets. You still need to train your model, which will incur usage on your account. 
-
-### Submit training job
-
-Replace the placeholders in the following request with your `{SECONDARY-ENDPOINT}` and `{SECONDARY-RESOURCE-KEY}` that you obtained in the first step.
-
-[!INCLUDE [train model](../includes/rest-api/train-model.md)]
-
-
-### Get training status
-
-Replace the placeholders in the following request with your `{SECONDARY-ENDPOINT}` and `{SECONDARY-RESOURCE-KEY}` that you obtained in the first step.
-
-[!INCLUDE [get training model status](../includes/rest-api/get-training-status.md)]
-
-## Deploy your model
-
-This is the step where you make your trained model available form consumption via the [runtime prediction API](https://aka.ms/ct-runtime-swagger). 
-
-> [!TIP]
-> Use the same deployment name as your primary project for easier maintenance and minimal changes to your system to handle redirecting your traffic.
-
-### Submit deployment job 
-
-Replace the placeholders in the following request with your `{SECONDARY-ENDPOINT}` and `{SECONDARY-RESOURCE-KEY}` that you obtained in the first step.
-
-[!INCLUDE [deploy model](../includes/rest-api/deploy-model.md)]
-
-### Get the deployment status
-
-Replace the placeholders in the following request with your `{SECONDARY-ENDPOINT}` and `{SECONDARY-RESOURCE-KEY}` that you obtained in the first step.
-
-[!INCLUDE [get deploy status](../includes/rest-api/get-deployment-status.md)]
-
-## Changes in calling the runtime
-
-Within your system, at the step where you call [runtime prediction API](https://aka.ms/ct-runtime-swagger) check for the response code returned from the submit task API. If you observe a **consistent** failure in submitting the request, this could indicate an outage in your primary region. Failure once doesn't mean an outage, it may be transient issue. Retry submitting the job through the secondary resource you have created. For the second request use your `{SECONDARY-ENDPOINT}` and `{SECONDARY-RESOURCE-KEY}`, if you have followed the steps above, `{PROJECT-NAME}` and `{DEPLOYMENT-NAME}` would be the same so no changes are required to the request body. 
-
-In case you revert to using your secondary resource you will observe slight increase in latency because of the difference in regions where your model is deployed. 
-
-## Check if your projects are out of sync
-
-Maintaining the freshness of both projects is an important part of the process. You need to frequently check if any updates were made to your primary project so that you move them over to your secondary project. This way if your primary region fails and you move into the secondary region you should expect similar model performance since it already contains the latest updates. Setting the frequency of checking if your projects are in sync is an important choice. We recommend that you do this check daily in order to guarantee the freshness of data in your secondary model.
-
-### Get project details
-
-Use the following url to get your project details, one of the keys returned in the body indicates the last modified date of the project. 
-Repeat the following step twice, one for your primary project and another for your secondary project and compare the timestamp returned for both of them to check if they are out of sync.
-
-  [!INCLUDE [get project details](../includes/rest-api/get-project-details.md)]
-
-
-Repeat the same steps for your replicated project using `{SECONDARY-ENDPOINT}` and `{SECONDARY-RESOURCE-KEY}`. Compare the returned `lastModifiedDateTime` from both projects. If your primary project was modified sooner than your secondary one, you need to repeat the steps of [exporting](#export-your-primary-project-assets), [importing](#import-to-a-new-project), [training](#train-your-model) and [deploying](#deploy-your-model).
-
-
-## Next steps
-
-In this article, you have learned how to use the export and import APIs to replicate your project to a secondary Language resource in other region. Next, explore the API reference docs to see what else you can do with authoring APIs.

This data will be used in the next step when training your model so that your model can learn from the labeled data to know which entities to extract. If you already have labeled data, you can directly [import](create-project.md#import-project) it into your project, but you need to make sure that your data follows the [accepted data format](../concepts/data-formats.md). See [create project](create-project.md#import-project) to learn more about importing labeled data into your project. If your data isn't labeled already, you can label it in the [Language Studio](https://aka.ms/languageStudio).
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-Before you can label your data, you need:
-
-* A successfully [created project](create-project.md) with a configured Azure blob storage account
-* Text data that [has been uploaded](design-schema.md#data-preparation) to your storage account.
-
-See the [project development lifecycle](../overview.md#project-development-lifecycle) for more information.
-
-## Data labeling guidelines
-
-After preparing your data, designing your schema and creating your project, you will need to label your data. Labeling your data is important so your model knows which words will be associated with the entity types you need to extract. When you label your data in [Language Studio](https://aka.ms/languageStudio) (or import labeled data), these labels are stored in the JSON document in your storage container that you have connected to this project. 
-
-As you label your data, keep in mind:
-
-* You can't add labels for Text Analytics for health entities as they're pretrained prebuilt entities. You can only add labels to new entity categories that you defined during schema definition. 
-
-If you want to improve the recall for a prebuilt entity, you can extend it by adding a list component while you are [defining your schema](design-schema.md).
-
-* In general, more labeled data leads to better results, provided the data is labeled accurately.
-
-* The precision, consistency and completeness of your labeled data are key factors to determining model performance. 
-
-    * **Label precisely**: Label each entity to its right type always. Only include what you want extracted, avoid unnecessary data in your labels.
-    * **Label consistently**:  The same entity should have the same label across all the documents.
-    * **Label completely**: Label all the instances of the entity in all your documents. 
-
-   > [!NOTE]
-   > There is no fixed number of labels that can guarantee your model will perform the best. Model performance is dependent on possible ambiguity in your schema, and the quality of your labeled data. Nevertheless, we recommend having around 50 labeled instances per entity type.
-
-## Label your data
-
-Use the following steps to label your data:
-
-1. Go to your project page in [Language Studio](https://aka.ms/languageStudio).
-
-2. From the left side menu, select **Data labeling**. You can find a list of all documents in your storage container.
-
-    <!--:::image type="content" source="../media/tagging-files-view.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the Language Studio screen for labeling data." lightbox="../media/tagging-files-view.png":::-->
-
-    >[!TIP]
-    > You can use the filters in top menu to view the unlabeled documents so that you can start labeling them.
-    > You can also use the filters to view the documents that are labeled with a specific entity type.
-
-3. Change to a single document view from the left side in the top menu or select a specific document to start labeling. You can find a list of all `.txt` documents available in your project to the left. You can use the **Back** and **Next** button from the bottom of the page to navigate through your documents.
-
-    > [!NOTE]
-    > If you enabled multiple languages for your project, you will find a **Language** dropdown in the top menu, which lets you select the language of each document. Hebrew is not supported with multi-lingual projects.
-
-4. In the right side pane, you can use the **Add entity type** button to add additional entities to your project that you missed during schema definition.
-
-    <!--:::image type="content" source="../media/tag-1.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing complete data labeling." lightbox="../media/tag-1.png":::-->
-
-5. You have two options to label your document:
-    
-    |Option |Description  |
-    |---------|---------|
-    |Label using a brush     | Select the brush icon next to an entity type in the right pane, then highlight the text in the document you want to annotate with this entity type.           |
-    |Label using a menu    | Highlight the word you want to label as an entity, and a menu will appear. Select the entity type you want to assign for this entity.        |
-    
-    The below screenshot shows labeling using a brush.
-    
-    :::image type="content" source="../media/tag-options.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the labeling options offered in Custom NER." lightbox="../media/tag-options.png":::
-    
-6. In the right side pane under the **Labels** pivot you can find all the entity types in your project and the count of labeled instances per each. The prebuilt entities will be shown for reference but you will not be able to label for these prebuilt entities as they are pretrained.
-
-7. In the bottom section of the right side pane you can add the current document you are viewing to the training set or the testing set. By default all the documents are added to your training set. See [training and testing sets](train-model.md#data-splitting) for information on how they are used for model training and evaluation.
-
-    > [!TIP]
-    > If you are planning on using **Automatic** data splitting, use the default option of assigning all the documents into your training set.
-
-7. Under the **Distribution** pivot you can view the distribution across training and testing sets. You have two options for viewing:
-   * *Total instances* where you can view count of all labeled instances of a specific entity type.
-   * *Documents with at least one label* where each document is counted if it contains at least one labeled instance of this entity.
-  
-7. When you're labeling, your changes are synced periodically, if they have not been saved yet you will find a warning at the top of your page. If you want to save manually, select **Save labels** button at the bottom of the page.
-
-## Remove labels
-
-To remove a label
-
-1. Select the entity you want to remove a label from.
-2. Scroll through the menu that appears, and select **Remove label**.
-
-## Delete entities
-
-You cannot delete any of the Text Analytics for health pretrained entities because they have a prebuilt component. You are only permitted to delete newly defined entity categories. To delete an entity, select the delete icon next to the entity you want to remove. Deleting an entity removes all its labeled instances from your dataset. 
-
-## Next steps
-
-After you've labeled your data, you can begin [training a model](train-model.md) that will learn based on your data.

-# Train your custom Text Analytics for health model
-
-Training is the process where the model learns from your [labeled data](label-data.md). After training is completed, you'll be able to view the [model's performance](view-model-evaluation.md) to determine if you need to improve your model.
-
-To train a model, you start a training job and only successfully completed jobs create a model. Training jobs expire after seven days, which means you won't be able to retrieve the job details after this time. If your training job completed successfully and a model was created, the model won't be affected. You can only have one training job running at a time, and you can't start other jobs in the same project. 
-
-The training times can be anywhere from a few minutes when dealing with few documents, up to several hours depending on the dataset size and the complexity of your schema.
-
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-* A successfully [created project](create-project.md) with a configured Azure blob storage account
-* Text data that [has been uploaded](design-schema.md#data-preparation) to your storage account.
-* [Labeled data](label-data.md)
-
-See the [project development lifecycle](../overview.md#project-development-lifecycle) for more information.
-
-## Data splitting
-
-Before you start the training process, labeled documents in your project are divided into a training set and a testing set. Each one of them serves a different function.
-The **training set** is used in training the model, this is the set from which the model learns the labeled entities and what spans of text are to be extracted as entities. 
-The **testing set** is a blind set that is not introduced to the model during training but only during evaluation. 
-After model training is completed successfully, the model is used to make predictions from the documents in the testing and based on these predictions [evaluation metrics](../concepts/evaluation-metrics.md) are calculated. Model training and evaluation are only for newly defined entities with learned components; therefore, Text Analytics for health entities are excluded from model training and evaluation due to them being entities with prebuilt components. It's recommended to make sure that all your labeled entities are adequately represented in both the training and testing set.
-
-Custom Text Analytics for health supports two methods for data splitting:
-
-* **Automatically splitting the testing set from training data**:The system splits your labeled data between the training and testing sets, according to the percentages you choose. The recommended percentage split is 80% for training and 20% for testing. 
-
- > [!NOTE]
- > If you choose the **Automatically splitting the testing set from training data** option, only the data assigned to training set will be split according to the percentages provided.
-
-* **Use a manual split of training and testing data**: This method enables users to define which labeled documents should belong to which set. This step is only enabled if you have added documents to your testing set during [data labeling](label-data.md).

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "breaking change",
    "modification_title": "Removal of REST API Quickstart Instructions"
}
```

### Explanation
The document `rest-api.md`, which provided comprehensive quickstart instructions for using the REST API in conjunction with custom Text Analytics for health, has been entirely removed. This update includes the deletion of 128 lines that detailed critical information such as prerequisites for creating Azure resources, instructions on uploading sample data, steps to create projects, importing datasets, training models, deploying projects, and making predictions. The removal of these detailed, step-by-step instructions represents a significant breaking change as users will no longer have access to foundational resources and guidance essential for effectively utilizing the REST API for their analytics tasks. This could notably impede users' ability to commence their work with the Language service seamlessly. For further details about this change, users can refer to the [blob URL](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/5c1bed979905d9737f8b9af96a6591f1ecffd115/articles%2Fai-services%2Flanguage-service%2Fcustom-text-analytics-for-health%2Fincludes%2Fquickstarts%2Frest-api.md).

-
-    > [!NOTE]
-    > If you get a message saying "*your login account is not an owner of the selected storage account's resource group*", your account needs to have an owner role assigned on the resource group before you can create a Language resource. Contact your Azure subscription owner for assistance.
-
-1. In the **Custom text classification & custom named entity recognition** section, select an existing storage account or select **New storage account**. These values are to help you get started, and not necessarily the [storage account values](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) you’ll want to use in production environments. To avoid latency during building your project connect to storage accounts in the same region as your Language resource.
-
-    |Storage account value  |Recommended value  |
-    |---------|---------|
-    | Storage account name | Any name |
-    | Storage account type | Standard LRS |
-
-1. Make sure the **Responsible AI Notice** is checked. Select **Review + create** at the bottom of the page, then select **Create**.

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "breaking change",
    "modification_title": "Removal of Model Deployment API Instructions"
}
```

### Explanation
The document `deploy-model.md`, which previously provided detailed instructions for submitting a deployment job using a PUT request in the custom Text Analytics for health service, has been fully removed. This change involves the deletion of 52 lines, which included critical information such as the API endpoint, required headers, the JSON request body format, and expected response behavior after submitting the deployment. The complete removal of this document signifies a breaking change, as users who relied on this guidance to deploy their models will now face difficulties doing so, leading to potential disruptions in their workflow. This removal could cause confusion among users attempting to manage their deployments effectively. For those interested in the specifics of this change, it can be viewed through the [blob URL](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/5c1bed979905d9737f8b9af96a6591f1ecffd115/articles%2Fai-services%2Flanguage-service%2Fcustom-text-analytics-for-health%2Fincludes%2Frest-api%2Fdeploy-model.md).

### Explanation
The document `export-project.md`, which provided detailed instructions for exporting a project using a POST request in the custom Text Analytics for health service, has been completely removed. This change involved the deletion of 51 lines that included the request URL format, required headers, JSON request body structure, and response details upon successful submission of the export job. The complete removal of this documentation constitutes a breaking change, as users who depended on this guidance to export their projects will now face obstacles in executing this operation without alternative instructions. This could lead to significant confusion among users trying to manage project exports effectively.

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "breaking change",
    "modification_title": "Removal of Results Querying Instructions for Custom Entity Recognition"
}
```

### Explanation
The document `get-results.md`, which provided instructions for querying the status and results of custom entity recognition tasks in the Text Analytics for health service, has been completely removed. This modification involves the deletion of 289 lines that included essential details such as the URL format for the API request, required placeholders, authentication headers, and a comprehensive example of the expected JSON response. The exclusion of this guidance signifies a breaking change, as users who relied on this information to retrieve results from their analysis jobs will now find themselves unable to access critical functionality. This action could lead to significant disruptions in user workflows, particularly for those managing entity recognition tasks. Further details regarding this modification can be located through the [blob URL](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/5c1bed979905d9737f8b9af96a6591f1ecffd115/articles%2Fai-services%2Flanguage-service%2Fcustom-text-analytics-for-health%2Fincludes%2Frest-api%2Fget-results.md).

-Once you send your API request, you’ll receive a `202` response indicating that the job was submitted correctly. In the response headers, extract the `operation-location` value. It will be formatted like this: 
-
-```rest
-{ENDPOINT}/language/authoring/analyze-text/projects/{PROJECT-NAME}/import/jobs/{JOB-ID}?api-version={API-VERSION}
-``` 
-
-`{JOB-ID}` is used to identify your request, since this operation is asynchronous. You’ll use this URL to get the import job status.  
-
-Possible error scenarios for this request:
-
-* The selected resource doesn't have [proper permissions](../../how-to/create-project.md#using-a-pre-existing-language-resource) for the storage account.
-* The `storageInputContainerName` specified doesn't exist.
-* Invalid language code is used, or if the language code type isn't string.
-* `multilingual` value is a string and not a boolean.

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "breaking change",
    "modification_title": "Removal of Project Import Instructions"
}
```

### Explanation
The document `import-project.md`, which provided guidance on how to import a labels file for custom Text Analytics projects, has been completely removed. This modification entails the deletion of 185 lines containing crucial information such as the API request format, required placeholders, authentication headers, and an extensive example of the JSON body to be used in the API request for importing project data. Additionally, the document detailed the response structure, potential error scenarios, and explained the implications of replacing existing project data with the import. This removal represents a breaking change, as users who relied on this documentation to import their labeled data into the service will lose their reference to essential operational procedures. This could disrupt workflows for users actively utilizing the custom Text Analytics service. For further details regarding this change, reference can be made to the [blob URL](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/5c1bed979905d9737f8b9af96a6591f1ecffd115/articles%2Fai-services%2Flanguage-service%2Fcustom-text-analytics-for-health%2Fincludes%2Frest-api%2Fimport-project.md).

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "breaking change",

}
```

### Explanation
The document `model-evaluation.md`, which provided users with instructions on how to obtain an evaluation summary for their trained models in the custom Text Analytics for health service, has been entirely removed. This change encompasses the deletion of 133 lines that previously included essential details such as the request URL, authentication headers, and an example of the expected JSON response that outlined evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and the confusion matrix for the entities evaluated. The removal of these instructions signifies a breaking change, as users who relied on this information to assess their model's performance will no longer have access to crucial documentation. This could result in significant disruptions for users engaged in monitoring and improving their model's performance. Further details on this change can be found at the [blob URL](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/5c1bed979905d9737f8b9af96a6591f1ecffd115/articles%2Fai-services%2Flanguage-service%2Fcustom-text-analytics-for-health%2Fincludes%2Frest-api%2Fmodel-evaluation.md).

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "breaking change",
    "modification_title": "Removal of Project Details Instructions"
}
```

### Explanation
The document `project-details.md`, which provided essential instructions for retrieving project details using a GET request, has been completely removed. This change includes the deletion of 57 lines of content that previously outlined the API endpoint structure, required placeholder values, authentication headers, and the expected JSON response format containing crucial project information such as created and modified dates, project type, storage container name, and language code. The removal of this document signifies a breaking change, as users who relied on this guide to access their project details will no longer have a reference to critical operational procedures. Consequently, this could hinder users in managing their custom Text Analytics projects effectively. For more details, reference can be made to the [blob URL](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/5c1bed979905d9737f8b9af96a6591f1ecffd115/articles%2Fai-services%2Flanguage-service%2Fcustom-text-analytics-for-health%2Fincludes%2Frest-api%2Fproject-details.md).

-# Language support for custom text analytics for health
-
-Use this article to learn about the languages currently supported by custom Text Analytics for health.
-
-## Multilingual option
-
-With custom Text Analytics for health, you can train a model in one language and use it to extract entities from documents other languages. This feature saves you the trouble of building separate projects for each language and instead combining your datasets in a single project, making it easy to scale your projects to multiple languages. You can train your project entirely with English documents, and query it in: French, German, Italian, and others. You can enable the multilingual option as part of the project creation process or later through the project settings.
-
-You aren't expected to add the same number of documents for every language. You should build the majority of your project in one language, and only add a few documents in languages you observe aren't performing well. If you create a project that is primarily in English, and start testing it in French, German, and Spanish, you might observe that German doesn't perform as well as the other two languages. In that case, consider adding 5% of your original English documents in German, train a new model and test in German again. In the [data labeling](how-to/label-data.md) page in Language Studio, you can select the language of the document you're adding. You should see better results for German queries. The more labeled documents you add, the more likely the results are going to get better. When you add data in another language, you shouldn't expect it to negatively affect other languages. 
-
-Hebrew is not supported in multilingual projects. If the primary language of the project is Hebrew, you will not be able to add training data in other languages, or query the model with other languages. Similarly, if the primary language of the project is not Hebrew, you will not be able to add training data in Hebrew, or query the model in Hebrew.
-
-## Language support
-
-Custom Text Analytics for health supports `.txt` files in the following languages:
-
-| Language | Language code |
-| --- | --- |
-| English | `en` |
-| French | `fr` |
-| German | `de` |
-| Spanish | `es` |
-| Italian | `it` |
-| Portuguese (Portugal) | `pt-pt` |
-| Hebrew | `he` |

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "breaking change",
    "modification_title": "Removal of Language Support Information for Custom Text Analytics"
}
```

### Explanation
The document `language-support.md`, which provided detailed information on the languages and regions supported by the Custom Text Analytics for health service, has been entirely removed. This change involved the deletion of 45 lines that included essential information regarding multilingual capabilities, supported languages, and practical guidance for users on how to manage documents in different languages within the context of their projects. Specifically, it explained how users could train models in one language while utilizing them to extract entities from documents in other languages, outlined certain limitations (like the restriction regarding Hebrew), and included a list of languages supported along with their respective language codes. The absence of this guidance constitutes a breaking change, as users who relied on this document for understanding language support within the service will no longer have access to critical information, potentially impacting their ability to develop multilingual models effectively. For further insights regarding this modification, users can refer to the [blob URL](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/5c1bed979905d9737f8b9af96a6591f1ecffd115/articles%2Fai-services%2Flanguage-service%2Fcustom-text-analytics-for-health%2Flanguage-support.md).

-# What is custom Text Analytics for health?
-
-> [!NOTE]
-> Custom text analytics for health (preview) will be retired on 10 January 2025, please transition to other custom model training services, such as custom named entity recognition in Azure AI Language, by that date. From now to 10 January 2025, you can continue to use custom text analytics for health (preview) in your existing projects without disruption. You can’t create new projects. On 10 January 2025 – workloads running on custom text analytics for health (preview) will be deleted and associated project data will be lost.
-
-Custom Text Analytics for health is one of the custom features offered by [Azure AI Language](../overview.md). It is a cloud-based API service that applies machine-learning intelligence to enable you to build custom models on top of [Text Analytics for health](../text-analytics-for-health/overview.md) for custom healthcare entity recognition tasks.
-
-Custom Text Analytics for health enables users to build custom AI models to extract healthcare specific entities from unstructured text, such as clinical notes and reports. By creating a custom Text Analytics for health project, developers can iteratively define new vocabulary, label data, train, evaluate, and improve model performance before making it available for consumption. The quality of the labeled data greatly impacts model performance. To simplify building and customizing your model, the service offers a web portal that can be accessed through the [Language studio](https://aka.ms/languageStudio). You can easily get started with the service by following the steps in this [quickstart](quickstart.md). 
- 
-This documentation contains the following article types:
-
-* [Quickstarts](quickstart.md) are getting-started instructions to guide you through creating making requests to the service.
-* [Concepts](concepts/evaluation-metrics.md) provide explanations of the service functionality and features.
-* [How-to guides](how-to/label-data.md) contain instructions for using the service in more specific or customized ways.
-
-## Example usage scenarios
-
-Similarly to Text Analytics for health, custom Text Analytics for health can be used in multiple [scenarios](../text-analytics-for-health/overview.md#example-use-cases) across a variety of healthcare industries. However, the main usage of this feature is to provide a layer of customization on top of Text Analytics for health to extend its existing entity map.
-
-
-## Project development lifecycle
-
-Using custom Text Analytics for health typically involves several different steps. 
-
-:::image type="content" source="media/development-lifecycle.png" alt-text="A diagram showing the project development lifecycle when working with custom models." lightbox="media/development-lifecycle.png":::
-
-* **Define your schema**: Know your data and define the new entities you want extracted on top of the existing Text Analytics for health entity map. Avoid ambiguity.
-
-* **Label your data**: Labeling data is a key factor in determining model performance. Label precisely, consistently and completely.
-    * **Label precisely**: Label each entity to its right type always. Only include what you want extracted, avoid unnecessary data in your labels.
-    * **Label consistently**:  The same entity should have the same label across all the files.
-    * **Label completely**: Label all the instances of the entity in all your files.
-
-* **Train the model**: Your model starts learning from your labeled data.
-
-* **View the model's performance**: After training is completed, view the model's evaluation details, its performance and guidance on how to improve it. 
-
-* **Deploy the model**: Deploying a model makes it available for use via an API.
-
-* **Extract entities**: Use your custom models for entity extraction tasks.
-
-## Reference documentation and code samples

-Use this article to get started with creating a custom Text Analytics for health project where you can train custom models on top of Text Analytics for health for custom entity recognition. A model is artificial intelligence software that's trained to do a certain task. For this system, the models extract healthcare related named entities and are trained by learning from labeled data.
-
-In this article, we use Language Studio to demonstrate key concepts of custom Text Analytics for health. As an example we’ll build a custom Text Analytics for health model to extract the Facility or treatment location from short discharge notes.

-# Terms and definitions used in custom Text Analytics for health
-
-Use this article to learn about some of the definitions and terms you may encounter when using Custom Text Analytics for health
-
-## Entity
-Entities are words in input data that describe information relating to a specific category or concept. If your entity is complex and you would like your model to identify specific parts, you can break your entity into subentities. For example, you might want your model to predict an address, but also the subentities of street, city, state, and zipcode. 
-
-## F1 score
-The F1 score is a function of Precision and Recall. It's needed when you seek a balance between [precision](#precision) and [recall](#recall).
-
-## Prebuilt entity component
-
-Prebuilt entity components represent pretrained entity components that belong to the [Text Analytics for health entity map](../../text-analytics-for-health/concepts/health-entity-categories.md). These entities are automatically loaded into your project as entities with prebuilt components. You can define list components for entities with prebuilt components but you cannot add learned components. Similarly, you can create new entities with learned and list components, but you cannot populate them with additional prebuilt components.
-
-
-## Learned entity component
-
-The learned entity component uses the entity tags you label your text with to train a machine learned model. The model learns to predict where the entity is, based on the context within the text. Your labels provide examples of where the entity is expected to be present in text, based on the meaning of the words around it and as the words that were labeled. This component is only defined if you add labels by labeling your data for the entity. If you do not label any data with the entity, it will not have a learned component. Learned components cannot be added to entities with prebuilt components.
-
-## List entity component
-A list entity component represents a fixed, closed set of related words along with their synonyms. List entities are exact matches, unlike machined learned entities.
-
-The entity will be predicted if a word in the list entity is included in the list. For example, if you have a list entity called "clinics" and you have the words "clinic a, clinic b, clinic c" in the list, then the size entity will be predicted for all instances of the input data where "clinic a, clinic b, clinic c" are used regardless of the context. List components can be added to all entities regardless of whether they are prebuilt or newly defined.
-
-## Model
-A model is an object that's trained to do a certain task, in this case custom Text Analytics for health models perform all the features of Text Analytics for health in addition to custom entity extraction for the user's defined entities. Models are trained by providing labeled data to learn from so they can later be used to understand context from the input text.
-
-* **Model evaluation** is the process that happens right after training to know how well does your model perform.
-* **Deployment** is the process of assigning your model to a deployment to make it available for use via the [prediction API](https://aka.ms/ct-runtime-swagger).
-
-## Overfitting
-
-Overfitting happens when the model is fixated on the specific examples and is not able to generalize well.
-
-## Precision
-Measures how precise/accurate your model is. It's the ratio between the correctly identified positives (true positives) and all identified positives. The precision metric reveals how many of the predicted entities are correctly labeled.
-
-## Project
-A project is a work area for building your custom ML models based on your data. Your project can only be accessed by you and others who have access to the Azure resource being used.
-
-## Recall
-Measures the model's ability to predict actual positive entities. It's the ratio between the predicted true positives and what was actually labeled. The recall metric reveals how many of the predicted entities are correct.
-
-
-## Schema
-Schema is defined as the combination of entities within your project. Schema design is a crucial part of your project's success. When creating a schema, you want think about what are the new entities should you add to your project to extend the existing [Text Analytics for health entity map](../../text-analytics-for-health/concepts/health-entity-categories.md) and which new vocabulary should you add to the prebuilt entities using list components to enhance their recall. For example, adding a new entity for patient name or extending the prebuilt entity "Medication Name" with a new research drug (Ex: research drug A).
-
-## Training data
-Training data is the set of information that is needed to train a model.

-# How to create Custom sentiment analysis project
-
-Use this article to learn how to set up the requirements for starting with Custom sentiment analysis and create a project.
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-Before you start using Custom sentiment analysis, you'll need:
-
-* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).
-
-## Create a Language resource 
-
-Before you start using Custom sentiment analysis, you'll need an Azure Language resource. It's recommended to create your Language resource and connect a storage account to it in the Azure portal. Creating a resource in the Azure portal lets you create an Azure storage account at the same time, with all of the required permissions preconfigured. You can also read further in the article to learn how to use a pre-existing resource, and configure it to work with Custom sentiment analysis.
-
-You also need an Azure storage account where you'll upload your `.txt` documents that will be used to train a model to classify text.
-
-> [!NOTE]
->  * You need to have an **owner** role assigned on the resource group to create a Language resource.
->  * If you will connect a pre-existing storage account, you should have an **owner** role assigned to it.
-
-## Create Language resource and connect storage account
-
-
-> [!Note]
-> You shouldn't move the storage account to a different resource group or subscription once it's linked with the Language resource.
-
-[!INCLUDE [create a new resource from the Azure portal](../../../includes/custom/resource-creation-azure-portal.md)]
-
-[!INCLUDE [create a new resource from Language Studio](../../../includes/custom/resource-creation-language-studio.md)]

-
-
----
-
-> [!NOTE]
-> * The process of connecting a storage account to your Language resource is irreversible, it cannot be disconnected later.
-> * You can only connect your language resource to one storage account.
-
-## Using a pre-existing Language resource
-
-[!INCLUDE [use an existing resource](../../../includes/custom/use-pre-existing-resource.md)]
-
-
-## Create a Custom sentiment analysis project
-
-Once your resource and storage container are configured, create a new Custom sentiment analysis project. A project is a work area for building your custom AI models based on your data. Your project can only be accessed by you and others who have access to the Azure resource being used. If you have labeled data, you can [import it](#import-a-custom-sentiment-analysis-project) to get started.

-# How to prepare data for custom sentiment analysis
-
-In order to create a Custom sentiment analysis model, you will need quality data to train it. This article covers how you should select and prepare your data, along with defining a schema. Defining the schema is the first step in the project development lifecycle, and it defines the classes that you need your model to classify your text into at runtime.
-
-## Data selection
-
-The quality of data you train your model with affects model performance greatly.
-
-* Use real-life data that reflects your domain's problem space to effectively train your model. You can use synthetic data to accelerate the initial model training process, but it will likely differ from your real-life data and make your model less effective when used.
-
-* Balance your data distribution as much as possible without deviating far from the distribution in real-life.
-
-* Use diverse data whenever possible to avoid overfitting your model. Less diversity in training data may lead to your model learning spurious correlations that may not exist in real-life data. 
- 
-* Avoid duplicate documents in your data. Duplicate data has a negative effect on the training process, model metrics, and model performance. 
-
-* Consider where your data comes from. If you are collecting data from one person, department, or part of your scenario, you are likely missing diversity that may be important for your model to learn about. 
-
-> [!NOTE]
-> If your documents are in multiple languages, select the **multiple languages** option during project creation and set the **language** option to the language of the majority of your documents.
-
-## Data preparation
-
-As a prerequisite for creating a Custom sentiment analysis project, your training data needs to be uploaded to a blob container in your storage account. You can create and upload training documents from Azure directly, or through using the Azure Storage Explorer tool. Using the Azure Storage Explorer tool allows you to upload more data quickly.  
-
-* [Create and upload documents from Azure](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal#create-a-container)
-* [Create and upload documents using Azure Storage Explorer](/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-blobs)
-
-You can only use `.txt`. documents for custom text. If your data is in other format, you can use [CLUtils parse command](https://github.com/microsoft/CognitiveServicesLanguageUtilities/blob/main/CustomTextAnalytics.CLUtils/Solution/CogSLanguageUtilities.ViewLayer.CliCommands/Commands/ParseCommand/README.md) to change your file format.
-
-## Test set
-
-When defining the testing set, make sure to include example documents that are not present in the training set. Defining the testing set is an important step to calculate the model performance<!--[model performance](view-model-evaluation.md#model-details)-->. Also, make sure that the testing set include documents that represent all classes used in your project.
-
-## Next steps
-
-If you haven't already, create a Custom sentiment analysis project. If it's your first time using Custom sentiment analysis, consider following the [quickstart](../quickstart.md) to create an example project. You can also see the [project requirements](../how-to/create-project.md) for more details on what you need to create a project.

-# Label text data for training your model for Custom sentiment analysis
-
-Before training your model you need to label your documents with the sentiments you want to categorize them into. This data will be used in the next step when training your model so that your model can learn from the labeled data. If you already have labeled data, you can directly [import](create-project.md) it into your project. Be sure that your data follows the [accepted data format](../concepts/data-formats.md).
-
-Before creating a Custom sentiment analysis model, you need to have labeled data first. If your data isn't labeled already, you can label it in the [Language Studio](https://aka.ms/languageStudio). Labeled data informs the model how to interpret text, and is used for training and evaluation.
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-Before you can label data, you need:
-
-* [A successfully created project](create-project.md) with a configured Azure blob storage account.
-* Documents containing text data that have [been uploaded](design-schema.md#data-preparation) to your storage account.
-
-See the [project development lifecycle](../../overview.md#project-development-lifecycle) for more information.
-
-## Data labeling guidelines
-
-After [preparing your data](design-schema.md) and [creating your project](create-project.md), you will need to label your data. Labeling your data is important so your model knows which documents will be associated with the sentiments you need. When you label your data in [Language Studio](https://aka.ms/languageStudio) (or import labeled data), these labels will be stored in the JSON file in your storage container that you've connected to this project. 
-
-As you label your data, keep in mind:
-
-* In general, more labeled data leads to better results, provided the data is labeled accurately.
-
-* There is no fixed number of labels that can guarantee your model will perform the best. Model performance on possible ambiguity in your [data](design-schema.md), and the quality of your labeled data.
-
-## Label your data
-
-Use the following steps to label your data:
-
-1. Go to your project page in [Language Studio](https://aka.ms/languageStudio).
-
-2. From the left side menu, select **Data labeling**. You can find a list of all documents in your storage container.
-
-    >[!TIP]
-    > You can use the filters in top menu to view the unlabeled files so that you can start labeling them.
-    > You can also use the filters to view the documents that are labeled with a specific sentiment.
-
-3. Change to a single file view from the left side in the top menu or select a specific file to start labeling. You can find a list of all `.txt` files available in your projects to the left. You can use the **Back** and **Next** button from the bottom of the page to navigate through your documents.
-
-    > [!NOTE]
-    > If you enabled multiple languages for your project, you will find a **Language** dropdown in the top menu, which lets you select the language of each document.
-
-
-4. In the right side pane, you can add sentiments to your project to start labeling your data with them. <!--You can also use the [auto labeling feature](use-autolabeling.md) to ensure complete labeling.-->
-
-6. In the right side pane under the **Labels** pivot you can find all the sentiments in your project and the count of labeled instances for each.
-
-7. In the bottom section of the right side pane you can add the current file you are viewing to the training set or the testing set. By default all the documents are added to your training set. Learn more about [training and testing sets](train-model.md#data-splitting) and how they are used for model training and evaluation.
-
-    > [!TIP]
-    > If you are planning on using **Automatic** data splitting use the default option of assigning all the documents into your training set.
-
-8. Under the **Distribution** pivot you can view the distribution across training and testing sets. You have two options for viewing:
-   * *Total instances* where you can view count of all labeled instances of a specific sentiment.
-   * *Documents with at least one label* where each document is counted if it contains at least one labeled instance of this sentiment.
-
-9. While you're labeling, your changes will be synced periodically, if they have not been saved yet you will find a warning at the top of your page. If you want to save manually, click on **Save labels** button at the bottom of the page.
-
-## Next steps
-
-After you've labeled your data, you can begin [training a model](train-model.md) that will learn based on your data.

-# How to train a Custom sentiment analysis model
-
-<!--Training is the process where the model learns from your [labeled data](label-data.md). After training is completed, you'll be able to [view the model's performance](view-model-evaluation.md) to determine if you need to improve your model.-->
-
-To train a model, start a training job. Only successfully completed jobs create a usable model. Training jobs expire after seven days. After this period, you won't be able to retrieve the job details. If your training job completed successfully and a model was created, it won't be affected by the job expiration. You can only have one training job running at a time, and you can't start other jobs in the same project. 
-
-The training times can be anywhere from a few minutes when dealing with few documents, up to several hours depending on the dataset size and the complexity of your schema.
-
-
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-Before you train your model, you need:
-
-* [A successfully created project](create-project.md) with a configured Azure blob storage account.
-<!--* Text data that has [been uploaded](design-schema.md#data-preparation) to your storage account.
-* [Labeled data](label-data.md).
-
-See the [project development lifecycle](../../overview.md#project-development-lifecycle) for more information.-->
-
-## Data splitting
-
-Before you start the training process, labeled documents in your project are divided into a training set and a testing set. Each one of them serves a different function.
-The **training set** is used in training the model, this is the set from which the model learns the class/classes assigned to each document. 
-The **testing set** is a blind set that is not introduced to the model during training but only during evaluation. 
-After the model is trained successfully, it is used to make predictions from the documents in the testing set. Based on these predictions, the model's evaluation metrics will be calculated. 
-It is recommended to make sure that all your classes are adequately represented in both the training and testing set.
-
-Custom sentiment analysis supports two methods for data splitting:
-
-* **Automatically splitting the testing set from training data**: The system will split your labeled data between the training and testing sets, according to the percentages you choose. The system attempts to have a representation of all classes in your training set. The recommended percentage split is 80% for training and 20% for testing. 
-
- > [!NOTE]
- > If you choose the **Automatically splitting the testing set from training data** option, only the data assigned to training set will be split according to the percentages provided.
-
-* **Use a manual split of training and testing data**: This method enables users to define which labeled documents should belong to which set. <!--This step is only enabled if you have added documents to your testing set during [data labeling](tag-data.md).-->
-

-
-[!INCLUDE [train model](../../includes/custom/rest-api/train-model.md)]
-
-### Get training job status
-
-Training could take sometime depending on the size of your training data and complexity of your schema. You can use the following request to keep polling the status of the training job until it is successfully completed.
-
- [!INCLUDE [get training model status](../../includes/custom/rest-api/get-training-status.md)]
-
----
-
-### Cancel training job

-
----
-
-## Next steps
-
-After training is completed, you will be able to view the model's performance to optionally improve your model if needed. Once you're satisfied with your model, you can deploy it, making it available to use for use.
