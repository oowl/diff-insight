 The extractive summarization API uses natural language processing techniques to locate key sentences in an unstructured text document. These sentences collectively convey the main idea of the document.
 
 Extractive summarization returns a rank score as a part of the system response along with extracted sentences and their position in the original documents. A rank score is an indicator of how relevant a sentence is determined to be, to the main idea of a document. The model gives a score between 0 and 1 (inclusive) to each sentence and returns the highest scored sentences per request. For example, if you request a three-sentence summary, the service returns the three highest scored sentences.

-
-[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../../includes/feature-preview.md)]
-
-In this article, you learn how to create an index and consume it from code. To create an index locally, we use the `promptflow-rag` package. To create a remote index on the cloud, we use the `azure-ai-ml` package. We consume the indexes using `langchain`.
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-You must have:
-
-- An [Azure AI Foundry hub](../../how-to/create-azure-ai-resource.md) and [project](../../how-to/create-projects.md).
-
-- An [Azure AI Search service connection](../../how-to/connections-add.md#create-a-new-connection) to index the sample product and customer data. If you don't have an Azure AI Search service, you can create one from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or see the instructions [here](/azure/search/search-create-service-portal).
-- Models for embedding:
-    - You can use an ada-002 embedding model from Azure OpenAI. The instructions to deploy can be found [here](../deploy-models-openai.md).
-    - OR you can use any another embedding model deployed in your Azure AI Foundry project. In this example we use Cohere multi-lingual embedding. The instructions to deploy this model can be found [here](../deploy-models-cohere-embed.md).
-
-## Build and consume an index locally
-
-We can build and consume an index locally. 
-
-### Required packages for local index operations
-
-Install the following packages required for local index creation.
-
-```bash
-pip install promptflow-rag langchain langchain-openai
-```
-### Configure AI Search for local use
-
-We use Azure AI Search as the index store. To get started, we can set up the Azure AI Search service using the following code:
-
-```python
-import os
-# set credentials to your Azure AI Search instance
-os.environ["AZURE_AI_SEARCH_KEY"] = "<your-ai-search-key>"
-os.environ["AZURE_AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT"] = "https://<your-ai-search-service>.search.windows.net"
-```
-
-### Build an index locally using Azure OpenAI embeddings
-
-To create an index that uses Azure OpenAI embeddings, we configure environment variables to connect to the model.
-
-```python
-import os
-# set credentials to your Azure OpenAI instance
-os.environ["OPENAI_API_VERSION"] = "2023-07-01-preview"
-os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<your-azure-openai-api-key>"
-os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"] = "https://<your-azure-openai-service>.openai.azure.com/"
-```
-
-Now let us build the index using the `build_index` function.
-
-```python
-from promptflow.rag.config import LocalSource, AzureAISearchConfig, EmbeddingsModelConfig
-from promptflow.rag import build_index
-
-local_index_aoai=build_index(
-    name="<your-index-name>" + "aoai",  # name of your index
-    vector_store="azure_ai_search",  # the type of vector store
-    embeddings_model_config=EmbeddingsModelConfig(
-        model_name="text-embedding-ada-002",
-        deployment_name="text-embedding-ada-002", # verify if your deployment name is same as model name
-    ),
-    input_source=LocalSource(input_data="<path-to-your-local-files>"),  # the location of your file/folders
-    index_config=AzureAISearchConfig(
-        ai_search_index_name="<your-index-name>" + "-aoai-store", # the name of the index store inside the azure ai search service
-    ),
-    tokens_per_chunk = 800, # Optional field - Maximum number of tokens per chunk
-    token_overlap_across_chunks = 0, # Optional field - Number of tokens to overlap between chunks
-)
-```
-
-The above code builds an index locally. It uses environment variables to get the AI Search service and also to connect to the Azure OpenAI embedding model. 
-
-### Build an index locally using other embedding models deployed in your Azure AI Foundry project
-
-To create an index that uses an embedding model deployed in your Azure AI Foundry project, we configure the connection to the model using a `ConnectionConfig` as shown below. The `subscription`, `resource_group` and `workspace` refers to the project where the embedding model is installed. The `connection_name` refers to the connection name for the model, which can be found in the Azure AI Foundry project settings page.
-
-```python
-from promptflow.rag.config import ConnectionConfig
-
-my_connection_config=ConnectionConfig(
-    subscription_id="<subscription_id>",
-    resource_group_name="<resource_group_name>",
-    workspace_name="<ai_foundry_project_name>",
-    connection_name="<serverless_connection_name>"
-    )
-```
-
-Now let us build the index using the `build_index` function.
-
-```python
-from promptflow.rag.config import LocalSource, AzureAISearchConfig, EmbeddingsModelConfig
-from promptflow.rag import build_index
-
-local_index_cohere=build_index(
-    name="<your-index-name>" + "cohere",  # name of your index
-    vector_store="azure_ai_search",  # the type of vector store
-    embeddings_model_config=EmbeddingsModelConfig(
-        model_name="cohere-embed-v3-multilingual", # in this example we use cohere multi lingual embedding
-        connection_config=my_connection_config # created in previous step
-    ),
-    input_source=LocalSource(input_data="<path-to-your-local-files>"),  # the location of your file/folders
-    index_config=AzureAISearchConfig(
-        ai_search_index_name="<your-index-name>" + "cohere-store", # the name of the index store inside the azure ai search service
-    ),
-    tokens_per_chunk = 800, # Optional field - Maximum number of tokens per chunk
-    token_overlap_across_chunks = 0, # Optional field - Number of tokens to overlap between chunks
-)
-```
-
-The above code builds an index locally. It uses environment variables to get the AI Search service and the connection config to connect to the embedding model. 
-
-### Consuming a local index
-
-The local index created can be used as a langchain retriever to consume it for search queries.
-
-```python
-from promptflow.rag import get_langchain_retriever_from_index
-
-# Get the OpenAI embedded Index
-retriever=get_langchain_retriever_from_index(local_index_aoai)
-retriever.get_relevant_documents("<your search query>")
-
-# Get the Cohere embedded Index
-retriever=get_langchain_retriever_from_index(local_index_cohere)
-retriever.get_relevant_documents("<your search query>")
-```
-### Registering the index in your Azure AI Foundry project (Optional)
-
-Optionally, you can register the index in your Azure AI Foundry project so that you or others who have access to your project can use it from the cloud. Before proceeding [install the required packages](#required-packages-for-remote-index-operations) for remote operations.
-
-#### Connect to the project
-
-```python
-# connect to the Azure AI Foundry project
-from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
-from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
-
-client=MLClient(
-    DefaultAzureCredential(), 
-    subscription_id="<subscription_id>",
-    resource_group_name="<resource_group_name>",
-    workspace_name="<ai_foundry_project_name>"
-    )
-```
-The `subscription`, `resource_group` and `workspace` in the above code refers to the project you want to connect to.
-
-#### Register the index
-
-```python
-from azure.ai.ml.entities import Index
-
-# register the index with Azure OpenAI embeddings
-client.indexes.create_or_update(
-    Index(name="<your-index-name>" + "aoai", 
-          path=local_index_aoai, 
-          version="1")
-          )
-
-# register the index with cohere embeddings
-client.indexes.create_or_update(
-    Index(name="<your-index-name>" + "cohere", 
-          path=local_index_cohere, 
-          version="1")
-          )
-```
-
-> [!NOTE]
-> Environment variables are intended for convenience in a local environment. However, if you register a local index created using environment variables, the index may not function as expected because secrets from environment variables won't be transferred to the cloud index. To address this issue, you can use a `ConnectionConfig` or `connection_id` to create a local index before registering.
-
-## Build an index (remotely) in your Azure AI Foundry project
-
-We build an index in the cloud in your Azure AI Foundry project. 
-
-### Required packages for remote index operations
-
-Install the following packages required for remote index creation.
-
-```bash
-pip install azure-ai-ml promptflow-rag langchain langchain-openai
-```
-
-### Connect to the Azure AI Foundry project
-
-To get started, we connect to the project. The `subscription`, `resource_group` and `workspace` in the code below refers to the project you want to connect to.
-
-```python
-# connect to the Azure AI Foundry project
-from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
-from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
-
-client=MLClient(
-    DefaultAzureCredential(), 
-    subscription_id="<subscription_id>",
-    resource_group_name="<resource_group_name>",
-    workspace_name="<ai_foundry_project_name>"
-    )
-```
-
-### Get the AI Search service connection
-
-This project should have a connection to the AI Search service. We retrieve the details from the project.
-
-```python
-ai_search_connection = client.connections.get("<ai_search_connection>")
-``` 
-
-### Connect to the embedding models
-
-You can connect to Azure OpenAI using Microsoft Entra ID connections or API key based connections.
-
-```python
-from azure.ai.ml.entities import IndexModelConfiguration
-## aoai connections - entra id
-aoai_connection = client.connections.get("<your_aoai_entra_id_connection>")
-embeddings_model_config = IndexModelConfiguration.from_connection(
-    aoai_connection, 
-    model_name="text-embedding-ada-002",
-    deployment_name="text-embedding-ada-002") # verify if your deployment name is same as model name
-
-## OR you can connect using API Key based connections 
-from azure.ai.ml.entities import IndexModelConfiguration
-## aoai connections - API Key
-aoai_connection = client.connections.get("<your_aoai_connection>", populate_secrets=True)
-embeddings_model_config = IndexModelConfiguration.from_connection(
-    aoai_connection, 
-    model_name="text-embedding-ada-002",
-    deployment_name="text-embedding-ada-002")
-```
-
-You can connect to embedding model deployed in your Azure AI Foundry project (non Azure OpenAI models) using the serverless connection. 
-
-```python
-from azure.ai.ml.entities import IndexModelConfiguration
-serverless_connection = client.connections.get("<my_embedding_model_severless_connection_name>")
-embeddings_model_config = IndexModelConfiguration.from_connection(cohere_serverless_connection)
-```
-
-### Select input data to build the index
-
-You can build the index from the following types of inputs:
-- Local files and folders
-- GitHub repositories
-- Azure Storage
-
-We can use the following code sample to use any of these sources and configure our `input_source`:
-
-```python
-# Local source
-from azure.ai.ml.entities import LocalSource
-
-input_source=LocalSource(input_data="<path-to-your-local-files>")
-
-# GitHub repository
-from azure.ai.ml.entities import GitSource
-
-input_source=GitSource(
-    git_url="https://github.com/rust-lang/book.git", # connecting to the RUST repo as an example
-    git_branch_name="main", 
-    git_connection_id="")
-
-# Azure Storage
-input_source_subscription = "<subscription>"
-input_source_resource_group = "<resource_group>"
-input_source_workspace = "<workspace>"
-input_source_datastore = "<datastore_name>"
-input_source_path = "path"
-
-input_source = f"azureml://subscriptions/{input_source_subscription}/resourcegroups/{input_source_resource_group}/workspaces/{input_source_workspace}/datastores/{input_source_datastore}/paths/{input_source_path}"
-```
-### Build the index on cloud
-
-Now we can build the index using the `ai_search_connection`, `embeddings_model_config` and `input_source`. We use the `build_index` function. If you're using an Azure Storage URL as your input source, you also need to provide a `UserIdentityConfiguration`.
-
-```python
-# from azure.ai.ml.entities.credentials import UserIdentityConfiguration # user specified identity used to access the data. Required when using an azure storage URL
-from azure.ai.ml.entities import AzureAISearchConfig
-
-client.indexes.build_index(
-    name="<index_name>", # name of your index
-    embeddings_model_config=embeddings_model_config, 
-    input_source=input_source, 
-    # input_source_credential=UserIdentityConfiguration(), # user specified identity used to access the data. Required when using an azure storage URL
-    index_config=AzureAISearchConfig(
-        ai_search_index_name="<index_name>",  # the name of the index store in AI search service
-        ai_search_connection_id=ai_search_connection.id, 
-    ),
-    tokens_per_chunk = 800, # Optional field - Maximum number of tokens per chunk
-    token_overlap_across_chunks = 0, # Optional field - Number of tokens to overlap between chunks
-)
-```
-
-Depending on the size of your input source data, the above steps might take some time to complete. Once the job completes, you can retrieve the index object.
-
-```python
-my_index=client.indexes.get(name="<index_name>", label="latest")
-```
-
-### Consuming a registered index from your project
-
-To consume a registered index from your project, you need to connect to the project and retrieve the index. The retrieved index can be used as a langhcain retriever to consume it. You can connect to the project with a `client` as shown here.
-
-```python
-from promptflow.rag import get_langchain_retriever_from_index
-
-my_index=client.indexes.get(
-    name="<registered_index_name>", 
-    label="latest")
-
-index_langchain_retriever=get_langchain_retriever_from_index(my_index.path)
-index_langchain_retriever.get_relevant_documents("<your search query>")
-```
-
-## A question and answer function to use the index
-
-We have seen how to build an index locally or in the cloud. Using this index, we build a QnA function that accepts a user question and provides an answer from the index data. First let us get the index as a langchain_retriever as shown [here](#consuming-a-registered-index-from-your-project). We now use this `retriever` in our function. This function uses the LLM as defined in the `AzureChatOpenAI` constructor. It uses the index as a langchain_retriever to query the data. We build a prompt template that accepts a context and a question. We use langchain's `RetrievalQA.from_chain_type` to put all these together and get us the answers.
-
-```python
-def qna(question: str, temperature: float = 0.0, prompt_template: object = None) -> str:
-    from langchain import PromptTemplate
-    from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
-    from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI

 To reduce the risk of unauthorized access, you can disable key-based authorization, and instead use Microsoft Entra ID for authorization. This configuration uses a Microsoft Entra ID value to authorize access to the storage account. The identity used to access storage is either the user's identity or a managed identity. The user's identity is used to view data in the Azure Machine Learning studio, or to run a notebook while authenticated with the user's identity.

Our recommended essential development steps are grounded in the [Microsoft Responsible AI Standard](https://aka.ms/RAI), which sets policy requirements that our own engineering teams follow. Much of the content of the Standard follows a pattern, asking teams to Identify, Measure, and Mitigate potential content risks, and plan for how to Operate the AI system as well.  
+This article provides an overview of the resources available to help you use AI responsibly. Our recommended essential development steps are grounded in the [Microsoft Responsible AI Standard](https://aka.ms/RAI), which sets policy requirements that our own engineering teams follow. Much of the content of the Standard follows a pattern, asking teams to Identify, Measure, and Mitigate potential content risks, and plan for how to Operate the AI system as well.  
 
 At Microsoft, our approach is guided by a governance framework rooted in AI principles, which establish product requirements and serve as our "north star." When we identify a business use case for generative AI, we first assess the potential risks of the AI system to pinpoint critical focus areas. 
 
 Once we identify these risks, we evaluate their prevalence within the AI system through systematic measurement, helping us prioritize areas that need attention. We then apply appropriate mitigations and measure again to assess effectiveness. 
 
 Finally, we examine strategies for managing risks in production, including deployment and operational readiness and setting up monitoring to support ongoing improvement after the application is live.
