# Insights

The update involves extensive refinements in Azure AI Search's documentation aimed at maintaining currency and enhancing clarity. Many documents have had their issue dates updated to signify recency and relevance. Such maintenance ensures that guidance provided aligns with the latest service capabilities and practices, instilling users' trust in the material as reliable references.

The correction of terminology and navigation instructions in quickstart documents, particularly in C#, JavaScript, and TypeScript guides, reinforces accurate instructional pathways for users. This change benefits newcomers following these guidelines to set up their Azure Search applications correctly, preventing setup errors born from ambiguous steps.

More fundamentally, two documents have been fully withdrawn, representing breaking changes. The collapse of performance benchmarks and search traffic analytics articles in Azure AI Search documentation suggests a pivot in strategy—either due to data obsolescence or shifts in tools and evaluative methods provided to users. Users who heavily depend on these benchmarks and analytics guidance for implementing search systems will need alternative resources, potentially complicating performance assessments and tracking strategies.

Furthermore, terminological adjustments in vector-related documentation denote significant moves towards precision in how Azure AI Search communicates its features. The change from "vectorized content" to "vector support" and refinement in descriptions of hybrid search signify a shift to more accurate articulations of Azure's capabilities, assisting clients in better comprehending and leveraging these functionalities. 

Finally, removal of images across various documents, particularly in the performance benchmarks section, appears to signal an overarching editorial shift towards minimizing unnecessary visuals unless directly supportive of the text. While this may lead to cleaner documentation, the absence of visually explanatory aids could pose challenges for visual learners or those who glean insights from graphical depictions accompanying complex concepts. 

Overall, these updates collectively bring Azure AI Search's documentation into higher alignment with user needs and current service strategies, underpinning a commitment to clarity, accuracy, and user-centered content design while opening a gap resulting from the removal of previously valuable benchmarking and analytics information.

 # AI enrichment in Azure AI Search
 
 In Azure AI Search, *AI enrichment* refers to integration with [Azure AI services](/azure/ai-services/what-are-ai-services) to process content that isn't searchable in its raw form. Through enrichment, analysis and inference are used to create searchable content and structure where none previously existed. 
 
-Because Azure AI Search is used for text and vector queries, the purpose of AI enrichment is to improve the utility of your content in search-related scenarios. Raw content must be text or images (you can't enrich vectors), but the output of an enrichment pipeline can be vectorized and indexed in a vector index using skills like [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md) for chunking and [AzureOpenAIEmbedding skill](cognitive-search-skill-azure-openai-embedding.md) for encoding. For more information about using skills in vector scenarios, see [Integrated data chunking and embedding](vector-search-integrated-vectorization.md).

-# Azure AI Search performance benchmarks
-
-> [!IMPORTANT]
-> These benchmarks apply to search services created *before April 3, 2024* on deployments that run on older infrastructure. The benchmarks also apply to nonvector workloads only. Updates are pending for services and workloads on the new limits. 
-
-Performance benchmarks are useful for estimating potential performance under similar configurations. Actual performance depends on a [variety of factors](search-performance-tips.md), including the size of your search service and the types of queries you're sending. 
-
-To help you estimate the size of search service needed for your workload, we ran several benchmarks to document the performance for different search services and configurations. 
-
-To cover a range of different use cases, we ran benchmarks for two main scenarios:
-
-* **E-commerce search** - This benchmark emulates a real e-commerce scenario and is based on the Nordic e-commerce company [CDON](https://cdon.com).
-* **Document search** - This scenario is comprised of keyword search over full text documents from [Semantic Scholar](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.447/). This emulates a typical document search solution.
-
-While these scenarios reflect different use cases, every scenario is different so we always recommend performance testing your individual workload. We've published a [performance testing solution using JMeter](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-performance-testing) so you can run similar tests against your own service.
-
-## Testing methodology
-
-To benchmark Azure AI Search's performance, we ran tests for two different scenarios at different tiers and replica/partition combinations.
-
-To create these benchmarks, the following methodology was used:
-
-1. The test begins at `X` queries per second (QPS) for 180 seconds. This was usually 5 or 10 QPS.
-2. QPS then increased by `X` and ran for another 180 seconds
-3. Every 180 seconds, the test increased by `X` QPS until average latency increased above 1000 ms or less than 99% of queries succeeded.
-
-The following graph gives a visual example of what the test's query load looks like:
-
-![Example test](./media/performance-benchmarks/example-test.png)
-
-Each scenario used at least 10,000 unique queries to avoid tests being overly skewed by caching.
-
-> [!IMPORTANT]
-> These tests only include query workloads. If you expect to have a high volume of indexing operations, be sure to factor that into your estimation and performance testing. Sample code for simulating indexing can be found in this [tutorial](tutorial-optimize-indexing-push-api.md).
-
-### Definitions
-
-- **Maximum QPS** -  the maximum QPS numbers are based on the highest QPS achieved in a test where 99% of queries completed successfully without throttling and average latency stayed under 1000 ms.
-
-- **Percentage of max QPS** - A percentage of the maximum QPS achieved for a particular test. For example, if a given test reached a maximum of 100 QPS, 20% of max QPS would be 20 QPS.
-
-- **Latency** - The server's latency for a query; these numbers don't include [round trip delay (RTT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_delay). Values are in milliseconds (ms).
-
-## Testing disclaimer
-
-The code we used to run these benchmarks is available on the [azure-search-performance-testing](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-performance-testing/tree/main/other_tools) repository. It's worth noting that we observed slightly lower QPS levels with the [JMeter performance testing solution](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-performance-testing) than in the benchmarks. The differences can be attributed to differences in the style of the tests. This speaks to the importance of making your performance tests as similar to your production workload as possible.
-
-> [!IMPORTANT]
-> These benchmarks in no way guarantee a certain level of performance from your service but can give you an idea of the performance you can expect based on your scenario.

-## Takeaways
-
-Through these benchmarks, you can get an idea of the performance Azure AI Search offers. You can also see difference between services at different tiers.
-
-Some key take ways from these benchmarks are:
-
-* An S2 can typically handle at least four times the query volume as an S1
-* An S2 typically has lower latency than an S1 at comparable query volumes
-* As you add replicas, the QPS a service can handle typically scales linearly (for example, if one replica can handle 10 QPS then five replicas can usually handle 50 QPS)
-* The higher the load on the service, the higher the average latency
-
-You can also see that performance can vary drastically between scenarios. If you're not getting the performance you expect, check out the [tips for better performance](search-performance-tips.md).

-# Collect telemetry data for search traffic analytics
-
-Search traffic analytics is a pattern for collecting telemetry about user interactions with your Azure AI Search application, such as user-initiated clickstream events and keyboard inputs. Using this information, you can determine the effectiveness of your search solution, including clickthrough rate and which query inputs yield zero results.
-
-Instrumentation has the following parts:
-
-+ Add a telemetry client
-+ Modify a search request to include a correlation Id that maps search results to user actions
-+ Create and send a custom event to Application Insights and use the visualization and reporting tools to view event data
-
-This pattern takes a dependency on [Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) (a feature of [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/)) to collect user data. It requires that you add instrumentation to your application code, as described in this article. Finally, you need a reporting mechanism to analyze the data. You can use any visualization tool that connects to Application Insights.
-
-> [!NOTE]
-> The pattern described in this article is for advanced scenarios and clickstream data generated by code you add to your client. In contrast, service logs are easy to set up, provide a range of metrics including search terms, and can be done in the Azure portal with no code required. We recommend that you enable logging for all scenarios. For more information, see [Collect and analyze log data](monitor-azure-cognitive-search.md).
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-+ [Azure AI Search](search-create-service-portal.md), any region, basic tier and above.
-
-+ [Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/create-workspace-resource).
-
-+ A rich client application providing an interactive search experience that includes clickstream events or other user actions that you want to correlate to search result selections.
-
-## Identify relevant search data
-
-To collect useful metrics for search traffic analytics, it's necessary to log some signals from the users of your search application. These signals signify content that users are interested in and that they consider relevant. For search traffic analytics, these include:
-
-+ User-generated search events: Only search queries initiated by a user are interesting. Other search requests, such as those used to populate facets or retrieve internal information, aren't important. Be sure to only instrument user-initiated events to avoid skew or bias in your results.
-
-+ User-generated clickstream events: On a search results page, a clickstream event generally means that a document is a relevant result for a specific search query.
-
-In your application code, you should correlate these events with the search results returned from a given query. By linking search and clickstream events with a correlation ID, you can gain a deeper understanding of how well your application's search functionality is performing.
-
-## Add search traffic analytics
-
-For Azure AI Search, the Azure [portal](https://portal.azure.com) provides a Search Traffic Analytics page that has C# and JavaScript code snippets for adding a telemetry client, request headers, and properties necessary for custom log events. 
-
-> [!IMPORTANT]
-> The Search traffic analytics portal page is currently outdated and references an obsolete client libary. The workaround is to use code snippets from the [azure-search-traffic-analytics](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-traffic-analytics) GitHub repository. This article includes code snippets from the GitHub repository.
-
-:::image type="content" source="media/search-traffic-analytics/azuresearch-trafficanalytics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal command and page for setting up Application Insights.":::
-
-## Step 1: Set up Application Insights
-
-Create an object that sends events to Application Insights. You can add instrumentation to your server-side application code or client-side code running in a browser, expressed here as C# and JavaScript variants. For other languages, see [supported platforms and frameworks](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview#supported-languages).
-
-Server-side telemetry captures metrics at the application layer, for example in applications running as a web service on Azure, or as an on-premises app on a corporate network. Server-side telemetry captures search and clickstream events, the position of a document in results, and query information, but your data collection will be scoped to whatever information is available at that layer.
-
-On the client, you might have other code that manipulates query inputs, adds navigation, or includes context (for example, queries initiated from a home page versus a product page). If this describes your solution, you might opt for client-side instrumentation so that your telemetry reflects the extra detail. How this extra detail is collected goes beyond the scope of this pattern, but you can review [Application Insights for web pages](/azure/azure-monitor/app/javascript#explore-browserclient-side-data) for help with that decision.
-
-In this step, provide a [connection string to Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/migrate-from-instrumentation-keys-to-connection-strings).
-
-### [**Visual Studio**](#tab/visual-studio-telemetry-client)
-
-A shortcut that works for some Visual Studio project types is reflected in the following steps.
-
-1. Open your solution in Visual Studio.
-
-1. On the **Project** menu, select **Connected services** > **Add** > **Azure Application Insights**.
-
-1. In Connect to dependency, select **Azure Application Insights**, and then select **Next**.
-
-1. Select your Azure subscription, your Application Insights resource, and then select **Finish**.
-
-At this point, your application is set up for application monitoring, which means all page loads in your client app are tracked with default metrics.
-
-If this shortcut didn't work for you, see [Enable Application Insights server-side telemetry](/azure/azure-monitor/app/asp-net-core#enable-application-insights-server-side-telemetry-visual-studio) or refer to code snippets in the adjacent tabs.
-
-### [**.NET**](#tab/dotnet-telemetry-client)
-
-```csharp
-var telemetryConfiguration = new TelemetryConfiguration
-{
-    ConnectionString = "<PUT YOUR CONNECTION STRING HERE>"
-};
-var telemetryClient = new TelemetryClient(telemetryConfiguration);
-```
-
-### [**JavaScript**](#tab/javascript-telemetry-client)
-
-```javascript
-const appInsights = new ApplicationInsights({ config: {
-  connectionString: '<PUT YOUR CONNECTION STRING HERE>'
-  /* ...Other Configuration Options... */
-} });
-appInsights.loadAppInsights();
-```
-
----
-
-## Step 2: Add instrumentation
-
-Add instrumentation code to your client application.
-
-### Correlate clickstream events with search results
-
-To correlate search requests with clicks, it's necessary to have a correlation ID that relates these two distinct events. Azure AI Search provides you with a search ID when you request it with an HTTP header.
-
-Having the search ID allows correlation of the metrics emitted by Azure AI Search for the request itself, with the custom metrics you're logging in Application Insights.
-
-### [**.NET**](#tab/dotnet-correlation)
-
-```csharp
-var client = new SearchClient(new Uri("https://contoso.search.windows.net"), "hotels-sample-index", new DefaultAzureCredential());
-
-// Generate a new correlation id for logs
-string searchId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
-string searchText = "*";
-SearchResults<SearchDocument> searchResults;
-
-// Set correlation id for search request
-using (HttpPipeline.CreateClientRequestIdScope(clientRequestId: searchId))
-{
-    searchResults = client.Search<SearchDocument>(searchText, options: new SearchOptions { IncludeTotalCount = true } );
-}
-```
-
-### [**JavaScript**](#tab/javascript-correlation)
-
-```javascript
-const searchId = uuidv4();
-const searchText = "*";
-const searchResults = await searchClient.search(searchText, { includeTotalCount: true, customHeaders: { "x-ms-client-request-id": searchId }});
-const properties = {
-    searchId: searchId,
-    serviceName: "<PUT YOUR SEARCH SERVICE NAME HERE, example contoso-search>",
-    indexName: "<PUT YOUR INDEX NAME HERE>",
-    searchText: searchText,
-    resultsCount: searchResults.count
-};
-appInsights.trackEvent({ name: "search" }, properties);
-```
-
----
-
-### Log custom events
-
-Every time that a search request is issued by a user, you should log that as a search event with the following schema on an [Application Insights custom event](/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics). Remember to log only user-generated search queries.
-
-+ **SearchId**: (guid) unique identifier of the search query (built into the search response)
-+ **SearchServiceName**: (string) search service name
-+ **IndexName**: (string) search service index to be queried
-+ **SearchText**: (string) search terms entered by the user
-+ **ResultCount**: (int) number of documents that were returned (built into the search response)
-
-> [!NOTE]
-> Request the count of user generated queries by adding `$count=true` to your search query. For more information, see [Search Documents (REST)](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/search-post#searchrequest).

-    resultsCount: searchResults.count
-};
-```
-
----
-
-### Send the custom event to Application Insights
-
-Add the custom even to the *custom events* table in Application Insights. For more information, see [Application Insights API for custom events and metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics).

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "breaking change",
    "modification_title": "Removal of search traffic analytics article. Locale: en_US"
}
```

### Explanation
The code diff indicates a significant update in which the entire article on search traffic analytics has been removed from the documentation. This action involves the deletion of 222 lines of content that previously provided guidance on collecting telemetry for Azure AI Search applications.

The removed content included detailed instructions on:
- How to enable and implement telemetry data collection for search traffic using Application Insights.
- Descriptions of instrumentation steps, including adding a telemetry client, modifying search requests, and sending custom events for user-initiated actions.
- Prerequisites for setting up Azure AI Search and Application Insights.
- How to log relevant user events for meaningful analytics, including search queries and clickstream data.
- Instructions on correlating clickstream events with search results to assess application performance.

The article's removal may affect users seeking guidance on implementing search traffic analytics with Azure AI Search, as it eliminated a resource that outlined processes for capturing and analyzing user behavior and interaction within search applications. Users will need to look for alternative resources or updated documentation to fulfill their analytics needs.

 + Automate indexing end-to-end. When data changes in the source (such as in Azure Storage, Azure SQL, or Cosmos DB), the indexer can move those updates through the entire pipeline, from retrieval, to document cracking, through optional AI-enrichment, data chunking, vectorization, and indexing.
 
-+ Batching and retry logic is built in (non-configurable). Azure AI Search has internal retry policies for throttling errors that surface due to the Azure OpenAI endpoint maxing out on token quotas for the embedding model. We recommend putting the indexer on a schedule (for example, every 5 minutes) so the indexer can process any calls that were throttled by the Azure OpenAI endpoint despite of the retry policies.

Content from each source document flows to fields in primary and secondary indexes during the same indexing run.

The queries execute in parallel and the results are merged into a single response and ranked accordingly.

If you need more control over translation, you can supplement with the [multi-language capabilities](search-language-support.md) that Azure AI Search supports for nonvector content, in hybrid search scenarios.
++ **Multilingual search**. Azure AI Search is designed for extensibility. If you have embedding models and chat models trained in multiple languages, you can call them through custom or built-in skills on the indexing side, or vectorizers on the query side. If you need more control over text translation, you can supplement with the [multi-language capabilities](search-language-support.md) that Azure AI Search supports for nonvector content, in hybrid search scenarios.
 
 + **Filtered vector search**. A query request can include a vector query and a [filter expression](search-filters.md). Filters apply to text and numeric fields, and are useful for metadata filters, and including or excluding search results based on filter criteria. Although a vector field isn't filterable itself, you can set up a filterable text or numeric field. The search engine can process the filter before or after the vector query executes.

 On the indexing side, Azure AI Search takes vector embeddings and uses a [nearest neighbors algorithm](vector-search-ranking.md) to place similar vectors close together in an index. Internally, it creates vector indexes for each vector field.
 
-How you get embeddings from your source content into Azure AI Search depends on whether you want to perform the work within an Azure AI Search indexing pipeline, or externally.  Azure AI Search offers [integrated data chunking and vectorization](vector-search-integrated-vectorization.md) in an indexer pipeline. You still provide the resources (endpoints and connection information to Azure OpenAI), but Azure AI Search makes all of the calls and handles the transitions. This approach requires an indexer, a supported data source, and a skillset that drives chunking and embedding. Otherwise, you can handle all vectorization separately, and then push prevectorized content to [vector fields](vector-search-how-to-create-index.md) in a vector store.

 On the query side, in your client application, you collect the query input from a user, usually through a prompt workflow. You can then add an encoding step that converts the input into a vector, and then send the vector query to your index on Azure AI Search for a similarity search. As with indexing, you can deploy the [integrated vectorization](vector-search-integrated-vectorization.md) to convert the question into a vector. For either approach, Azure AI Search returns documents with the requested `k` nearest neighbors (kNN) in the results.
 
-Azure AI Search supports [hybrid scenarios](hybrid-search-overview.md) that run vector and keyword search in parallel, returning a unified result set that often provides better results than just vector or keyword search alone. For hybrid, vector and nonvector content is ingested into the same index, for queries that run side by side.

 ### About vector search
 
-Vector search is a method of information retrieval where documents and queries are represented as vectors instead of plain text. In vector search, machine learning models generate the vector representations of source inputs, which can be text, images, or other content. Having a mathematic representation of content provides a common basis for search scenarios. If everything is a vector, a query can find a match in vector space, even if the associated original content is in different media or language than the query.
