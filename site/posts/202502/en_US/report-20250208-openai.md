+## Markdown output
+
+By default the `o3-mini` and `o1` models will not attempt to produce output that includes markdown formatting. A common use case where this behavior is undesirable is when you want the model to output code contained within a markdown code block. When the model generates output without markdown formatting you lose features like syntax highlighting, and copyable code blocks in interactive playground experiences. To override this new default behavior and encourage markdown inclusion in model responses, add the string `Formatting re-enabled` to the beginning of your developer message.
+
+Adding `Formatting re-enabled` to the beginning of your developer message does not guarantee that the model will include markdown formatting in its response, it only increases the likelihood. We have found from internal testing that `Formatting re-enabled` is less effective by itself with the `o1` model than with `o3-mini`.
+
+To improve the performance of `Formatting re-enabled` you can further augment the beginning of the developer message which will often result in the desired output. Rather than just adding `Formatting re-enabled` to the beginning of your developer message, you can experiment with adding a more descriptive initial instruction like one of the examples below:
+
+- `Formatting re-enabled - please enclose code blocks with appropriate markdown tags.`
+- `Formatting re-enabled - code output should be wrapped in markdown.`
+
+Depending on your expected output you may need to customize your initial developer message further to target your specific use case.

}
```

### Explanation
The code diff indicates a minor update to the `reasoning.md` file, adding clarity and additional guidance regarding the usage of reasoning models in Azure OpenAI. The modification introduces 16 new lines and updates the "ms.date" to reflect a new publishing date.

Significant additions include guidance on using system messages with the `o3-mini` and `o1` models, emphasizing that when a system message is employed, it is treated as a developer message. Importantly, it advises users against mixing both message types in a single API request to avoid potential issues.

Furthermore, a new section titled "Markdown output" has been included, detailing default behavior changes in the `o3-mini` and `o1` models concerning markdown formatting. It explains the impact of the absence of markdown formatting on usability, especially in preserving code block features like syntax highlighting. 

To encourage markdown inclusion in responses, users are advised to prepend their developer message with "Formatting re-enabled." The update highlights that while this adjustment increases the likelihood of markdown being used, it does not guarantee it. Examples for more effective usage are provided, urging users to customize their developer messages according to their specific needs.

Overall, these enhancements improve user understanding of model behavior and provide actionable tips for optimizing interactions with reasoning models.

Previously, the documentation stated that an Azure OpenAI resource needed to be created in either the "East US 2 or Sweden Central" regions. This has since been revised to indicate that the resource can be established in "one of the supported regions." This adjustment acknowledges the possibility of additional supported regions beyond the originally specified locations. Furthermore, the updated text guides users to the "models and versions documentation" for further details on regional availability.

This modification improves the documentation's clarity and usability by broadening the scope of supported regions and providing users with an efficient way to find necessary information regarding where they may deploy their Azure OpenAI resources. Overall, such changes enhance the user experience by facilitating a better understanding of region requirements when using REST with Azure OpenAI.

### Summary

{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Update to Azure OpenAI Resource Region Availability Information"
}
```

### Explanation
The code diff reflects a minor update to the `audio-completions-typescript.md` file in the Azure OpenAI documentation. This change involves an adjustment to the requirements for creating an Azure OpenAI resource, specifically regarding the regions in which this resource can be established.

Initially, the documentation indicated that an Azure OpenAI resource should be created exclusively in the "East US 2 or Sweden Central" regions. This requirement has now been modified to allow the resource to be created "in one of the supported regions." This tweak not only broadens the potential choices for users but also links them to the "models and versions documentation" for detailed information regarding regional availability.

This update enhances the document by making it clearer that users have more flexibility in selecting a region for their Azure OpenAI resource deployment. Additionally, it directs users to relevant resources for further information, thereby improving the overall clarity and usability of the documentation for those working with audio completions in TypeScript using Azure OpenAI.

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Removal of Spain Central from Provisioned Global Model Matrix"
}
```

### Explanation
The code diff indicates a minor update to the `provisioned-global.md` file in the Azure OpenAI documentation. This change involves the removal of the "spaincentral" region from the list of regions available for various provisioned models.

The document previously contained a row that confirmed the availability of specific models in the "spaincentral" region, aligning with the updated availability notes. However, this row has now been deleted, indicating that this region is no longer supported for the listed models.

The update helps to ensure that the documentation accurately reflects the currently supported regions for provisioning OpenAI models. Users relying on this information for their deployment strategies will benefit from the improved clarity, avoiding potential confusion regarding model availability in the "spaincentral" region. Overall, this alteration maintains the document's integrity by ensuring that only relevant and accurate regional information is presented.
