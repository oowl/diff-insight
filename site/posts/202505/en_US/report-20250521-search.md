 1. Review [supported data types](/rest/api/searchservice/supported-data-types). The data type affects how the field is used. For example, numeric content is filterable but not full text searchable. The most common data type is `Edm.String` for searchable text, which is tokenized and queried using the full text search engine. The most common data type for a vector field is `Edm.Single` but you can use other types as well.
 
+1. Provide a description of the index (preview), 4,000 character maximum. This human-readable text is invaluable when a system must access several indexes and make a decision based on the description. Consider a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that must pick the correct index at run time. The decision can be  based on the description rather than on index name alone. An index Description field is available in the [2025-05-01-preview REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2025-05-01-preview&preserve-view=true), the Azure portal, or a prerelease package of an Azure SDK that provides the feature. For more information, see [Add an index description](search-howto-reindex.md#add-an-index-description-preview).

 1. Identify a [document key](#document-keys). A document key is an index requirement. It's a single string field populated from a source data field that contains unique values. For example, if you're indexing from Blob Storage, the metadata storage path is often used as the document key because it uniquely identifies each blob in the container.

 The security filter efficiently matches the userIds, groupIds, and rbacScope from the user against each list of ACLs in every document in the search index to limit the results returned to ones the user has access to. It's important to note that each filter is applied independently and a document is considered authorized if any filter succeeds. For example, if a user has access to a document through userIds but not through groupIds, the document is still considered valid and returned to the user.
 
 ## Limitations
+
 - If ACL evaluation fails (for example, Graph API is unavailable), the service returns **5xx** and does **not** return a partially filtered result set.
 - Document visibility requires both:
   - the calling application’s RBAC role (Authorization header), and  
   - the user identity carried by **x-ms-query-source-authorization**.

### Explanation
The code diff shows a minor update to the `vector-search-vectorizer-custom-web-api.md` file, comprising 2 changes: 1 addition and 1 deletion. These changes primarily pertain to the description of the `authIdentity` parameter used for connecting the search service to the function or application that hosts the code.

In this update, the documentation clarifies that `authIdentity` is an optional parameter allowing the use of a user-managed identity for authentication. It reinforces the option for either a system-managed or user-managed identity, highlighting the proper usage by stating that if a system-managed identity is chosen, the `authIdentity` field should be left blank. 

The explanation around the `authResourceId` parameter is more enhanced, emphasizing its role in scoping authentication tokens and specifying its required formats. Moreover, the document maintains essential references to external configuration guidelines for managed identities and Microsoft Entra authentication, ensuring that users have the necessary background to configure these settings correctly.

Overall, the updates aim to improve the comprehensiveness and readability of the documentation, making it easier for users to understand how to connect to their custom web APIs using Azure's vector search capabilities. By refining the descriptions and preserving crucial information about authentication options, this modification supports users in applying these technologies effectively.
