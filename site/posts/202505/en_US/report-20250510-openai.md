In the provisioned migration documentation, the shift towards emphasizing self-service migration processes provides clarity on associated costs and responsibilities. By stripping away the managed migration details, users are guided to focus on the essential elements of self-service migration decisions. This implies a likely intention to encourage more informed and independent migration practices, reflecting the service's adaptability in handling various user needs with differing complexity.

The comprehensive revisions made to the model availability matrices serve as a critical tool in keeping users informed about which models they can utilize based on their geographical location. As regions continue to evolve with new support capabilities for AI models, having accurate and up-to-date information allows for optimal deployment choices and strategic planning.

-### Managed migration
-
-The managed migration approach involves the customer partnering with Microsoft to bulk-migrate all the PTU commitments in a subscription/region at the same time. It works like this:
-
-1. The customer will engage their account team and request a managed migration. A migration owner from the Microsoft team will be assigned to assist the customer with migration.
-2. A date will be selected when all resources within each of the customers' subscriptions and regions containing current PTU commitments will be migrated from committed to hourly/reservation billing model. Multiple subscriptions and regions can be migrated on the same date.
-3. On the agreed-upon date:
-    * The customer will purchase regional reservations to cover the committed PTUs that will be converted and pass the reservation information to their Microsoft migration contact.
-    * Within 2-3 business days, all commitments will be proactively canceled and deployments previously under commitments will begin using the hourly/reservation payment model.
-    * In the billing period after the one with the reservation purchase, the customer will receive a credit for the reservation purchase covering the portions of the commitments that were canceled, starting from the time of the reservation purchase.
-
-Customers must reach out to their account teams to schedule a managed migration.
-
-**Managed migration advantages:**
-
-- Bulk migration of all commitments in a subscription/region is beneficial for customers with many commitments.
-- Seamless cost migration: No possibility of double-billing or extra hourly charges.
-
-**Managed migration disadvantages:**
-
-- All commitments in a subscription/region must be migrated at the same time.
-- Needing to coordinate a time for migration with the Microsoft team.

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Update to Standard Global Model Matrix"
}
```

### Explanation
This code diff shows a minor update to the `standard-global.md` file, which is part of the model matrix for Azure OpenAI Service. The changes primarily involve modifications to the availability of various AI models across different regions.

The update includes the addition of availability indicators (✅) in the regions for several models, reflecting shifts in which models are accessible in specific areas. For instance, models such as `gpt-4.1`, `o3`, `o4-mini`, and others show new availability statuses in regions like Australia East, Germany West Central, Poland Central, Spain Central, and so forth.

Moreover, certain entries have been cleared or adjusted, indicating changes in model support, likely correlating with updates in the service offerings or deployments of those models. The revised documentation thus provides a current and clearer representation of model availability, which helps users efficiently determine which models they can use depending on their geographic location. 

For further details, users can refer to the provided blob URL to view the full changes made.
