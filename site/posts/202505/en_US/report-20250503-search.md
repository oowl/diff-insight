+title: Integrated Vectorization Using REST APIs
+titleSuffix: Azure AI Search
+description: Learn how to use skills to automate data chunking and vectorization during indexing and query execution.
+manager: nitinme
+author: haileytap

+
+# Set up integrated vectorization in Azure AI Search using REST
+
+In this article, you learn how to use a skillset to chunk and vectorize content from a [supported data source](#supported-data-sources). The skillset calls the [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md) or [Document Layout skill](cognitive-search-skill-document-intelligence-layout.md) for chunking and an embedding skill that's attached to a [supported embedding model](#supported-embedding-models) for chunk vectorization. You also learn how to store the chunked and vectorized content in a [vector index](vector-search-how-to-create-index.md).
+
+This article describes the end-to-end workflow for [integrated vectorization](vector-search-integrated-vectorization.md) using REST<!--or Python-->. For portal-based instructions, see [Quickstart: Vectorize text and images in the Azure portal](search-get-started-portal-import-vectors.md).
+
+## Prerequisites
+
++ An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
+
++ An [Azure AI Search service](search-create-service-portal.md). We recommend the Basic tier or higher.
+
++ A [supported data source](#supported-data-sources).
+
++ A [supported embedding model](#supported-embedding-models).
+
++ Completion of [Quickstart: Connect without keys](search-get-started-rbac.md) and [Configure a system-assigned managed identity](search-howto-managed-identities-data-sources.md#create-a-system-managed-identity). Although you can use key-based authentication for data plane operations, this article assumes [roles and managed identities](#role-based-access), which are more secure.
+
++ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with a [REST client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)<!--or the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Jupyter package](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/)-->.
+
+### Supported data sources
+
+Integrated vectorization works with [all supported data sources](search-indexer-overview.md#supported-data-sources). However, this article focuses on the most commonly used data sources, which are described in the following table.
+
+| Supported data source | Description |
+|--|--|
+| [Azure Blob Storage](search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage.md) | This data source works with blobs and tables. You must use a standard performance (general-purpose v2) account. Access tiers can be hot, cool, or cold. |
+| [Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2](/azure/storage/blobs/create-data-lake-storage-account) | This is an Azure Storage account with a hierarchical namespace enabled. To confirm that you have Data Lake Storage, check the **Properties** tab on the **Overview** page.<br><br> :::image type="content" source="media/search-how-to-integrated-vectorization/data-lake-storage-account.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an Azure Data Lake Storage account in the Azure portal." border="true" lightbox="media/search-how-to-integrated-vectorization/data-lake-storage-account.png"::: |
+<!--| [OneLake](search-how-to-index-onelake-files.md) | This data source is currently in preview. For information about limitations and supported shortcuts, see [OneLake indexing](search-how-to-index-onelake-files.md). |-->
+
+### Supported embedding models
+
+For integrated vectorization, you must use one of the following embedding models on an Azure AI platform in the [same region as Azure AI Search](search-create-service-portal.md#regions-with-the-most-overlap). Deployment instructions are provided in a [later section](#prepare-your-embedding-model).
+
+| Provider | Supported models |
+|--|--|
+| [Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource) <sup>1, 2</sup> | text-embedding-ada-002<br>text-embedding-3-small<br>text-embedding-3-large |
+| [Azure AI services multi-service resource](/azure/ai-services/multi-service-resource#azure-ai-services-resource-for-azure-ai-search-skills) <sup>3</sup> | For text and images: [Azure AI Vision multimodal](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/how-to/image-retrieval) <sup>4</sup></li> |
+<!--| [Azure AI Foundry model catalog](/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry) | For text:<br>Cohere-embed-v3-english<br>Cohere-embed-v3-multilingual<br><br>For images:<br>Facebook-DinoV2-Image-Embeddings-ViT-Base<br>Facebook-DinoV2-Image-Embeddings-ViT-Giant |-->
+
+<sup>1</sup> The endpoint of your Azure OpenAI resource must have a [custom subdomain](/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains), such as `https://my-unique-name.openai.azure.com`. If you created your resource in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), this subdomain was automatically generated during resource setup.
+
+<sup>2</sup> Azure OpenAI resources (with access to embedding models) that were created in the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/) aren't supported. Only Azure OpenAI resources created in the Azure portal are compatible with the [Azure OpenAI Embedding skill](cognitive-search-skill-azure-openai-embedding.md) integration.
+
+<sup>3</sup> For billing purposes, you must [attach your Azure AI multi-service resource](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md) to the skillset in your Azure AI Search service. Unless you use a [keyless connection (preview)](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md#bill-through-a-keyless-connection) to create the skillset, both resources must be in the same region.
+
+<sup>4</sup> The Azure AI Vision multimodal embedding model is available in [select regions](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview-image-analysis#region-availability).
+
+### Role-based access
+
+You can use Microsoft Entra ID with role assignments or key-based authentication with full-access connection strings. For Azure AI Search connections to other resources, we recommend role assignments.
+
+To configure role-based access for integrated vectorization:
+
+1. On your search service, [enable roles](search-security-enable-roles.md) and [configure a system-assigned managed identity](search-howto-managed-identities-data-sources.md#create-a-system-managed-identity).
+
+1. On your data source platform and embedding model provider, create role assignments that allow your search service to access data and models. See [Prepare your data](#prepare-your-data) and [Prepare your embedding model](#prepare-your-embedding-model).
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> Free search services support role-based connections to Azure AI Search. However, they don't support managed identities on outbound connections to Azure Storage or Azure AI Vision. This lack of support requires key-based authentication on connections between free search services and other Azure resources.
+>
+> For more secure connections, use the Basic tier or higher. You can then enable roles and configure a managed identity for authorized access.
+
+## Get connection information for Azure AI Search
+
+In this section, you retrieve the endpoint and Microsoft Entra token for your Azure AI Search service. Both values are necessary to establish connections in REST<!--and Python--> requests.
+
+> [!TIP]
+> The following steps assume that you're using [role-based access](#role-based-access) for proof-of-concept testing. If you want to use integrated vectorization for app development, see [Connect your app to Azure AI Search using identities](keyless-connections.md).
+
+1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and select your Azure AI Search service.
+
+1. To obtain your search endpoint, copy the URL on the **Overview** page. An example search endpoint is `https://my-service.search.windows.net`.
+
+1. To obtain your Microsoft Entra token, run the following command on your local system. This step requires completion of [Quickstart: Connect without keys](search-get-started-rbac.md).
+
+   ```Azure CLI
+   az account get-access-token --scope https://search.azure.com/.default --query accessToken --output tsv
+   ```
+
+## Prepare your data

+## Create a skillset
+
+In this section, you create a [skillset](cognitive-search-working-with-skillsets.md) that calls a built-in skill to chunk your content and an embedding skill to create vector representations of the chunks. The skillset is executed during indexing in a [later section](#create-an-indexer).
+
+### Call a built-in skill to chunk your content
+
+Partitioning your content into chunks helps you meet the requirements of your embedding model and prevents data loss due to truncation. For more information about chunking, see [Chunk large documents for vector search solutions](vector-search-how-to-chunk-documents.md).
+
+For built-in data chunking, Azure AI Search offers the [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md) and [Document Layout skill](cognitive-search-skill-document-intelligence-layout.md). The Text Split skill breaks text into sentences or pages of a particular length, while the Document Layout skill breaks content based on paragraph boundaries.

+
+## Create a vector index
+
+In this section, you set up physical data structures on your Azure AI Search service by creating a [vector index](vector-store.md). The schema of a vector index requires the following:
+
++ Name
++ Key field (string)
++ One or more vector fields
++ Vector configuration
+
+Vector fields store numerical representations of your chunked data. They must be searchable and retrievable, but they can't be filterable, facetable, or sortable. They also can't have analyzers, normalizers, or synonym map assignments.
+
+In addition to vector fields, the sample index in the following steps contains nonvector fields for human-readable content. It's common to include plain-text equivalents of the content you want to vectorize. For more information, see [Create a vector index](vector-search-how-to-create-index.md).
+
+<!--### [REST](#tab/vector-index-rest)-->
+
+1. Use [Create Index](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create) to define the schema of a vector index.
+
+   ```HTTP

+
+1. Add a [vector search configuration](vector-search-how-to-create-index.md#add-a-vector-search-configuration) to the `vectorSearch` section.
+
+   ```HTTP
+       "vectorSearch": {
+         "algorithms": [
+           {

+           }
+         ]
+       }
+   ```
+
+   `vectorSearch.algorithms` specifies the algorithm used for indexing and querying vector fields, while `vectorSearch.profiles` links the algorithm configuration to a profile you can assign to vector fields.
+
+1. Depending on your embedding model, update `vectorSearch.algorithms.metric`. [Valid values for distance metrics](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update#vectorsearchalgorithmmetric) are `cosine`, `dotproduct`, `euclidean`, and `hamming`.
+
+1. Add fields to the `fields` arrays. Include a key field for document identification, nonvector fields for human-readable content, and vector fields for embeddings.
+
+   ```HTTP
+       "fields": [
+         {
+           "name": "id",
