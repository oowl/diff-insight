# Insights
The recent diff introduces a series of metadata-focused updates to several Azure AI Search documentation files. The purpose is to bring the documentation in line with updated organizational standards and enhance its discoverability and clarity. Key to these updates is the addition of the "build-2025" tag in the `ms.custom` field across documents, linking the content to current projects and events, notably "build-2025," thereby enhancing its relevance.

Moreover, the `ms.date` fields have been updated to reflect the near-term dates in 2025, substantiating the current relevance of the documentation. Although content changes are minimal, several documents, such as "search-agentic-retrieval-concept.md" and "search-import-data-portal.md," have seen refinements in metadata and minor content restructuring to improve clarity and presentation. These updates aim to provide a more consistent user experience while ensuring users receive accurate and up-to-date information.

Overall, these improvements to metadata fields pave the way for improved navigation and better informational architecture within the Azure AI Search portal. The structured updates signal an ongoing commitment to user experience and organizational coherence, ensuring documents not only align with internal standards but also cater to external user needs by providing clear, relevant, and timely content.
