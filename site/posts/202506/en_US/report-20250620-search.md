# Highlights
Two documentation files were minorly updated to correctly represent the maximum dimension for vector fields within the Azure OpenAI service. The corrected maximum dimensions attribute is now specified as 4096 instead of previous inaccurate values in both `search-get-started-vector.md` and `search-limits-quotas-capacity.md`.

## New features
None.

## Breaking changes
None.

## Other updates
- The maximum of floating point values for dimensions was corrected in the `search-get-started-vector.md` documentation.
- The limits table was adjusted in `search-limits-quotas-capacity.md` to consistently reflect the corrected maximum dimensions for vector fields.

# Insights
This recent update addresses textual inaccuracies in the documentation concerning vector fields' dimensions within the Azure OpenAI service. Originally, the documentation specified inconsistent maximum values for floating point dimensionsâ€”namely, a maximum of 3,072 or 4,098. Both these inaccuracies have been corrected to reflect an accurate maximum of 4096. This correction is crucial because it ensures that developers and users who depend on these specifications are correctly informed about the service's capabilities.

Vector fields are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence models for representing data in multidimensional spaces. Properly, understanding the constraints of these dimensions is vital for model development and optimization. The adjustment of this documentation ensures developers are aware of the correct boundaries when implementing and tuning their models, allowing for more efficient use of the Azure service and preventing misconfigurations that might lead to unexpected errors or inefficient use of resources.

By correcting these discrepancies, Microsoft is maintaining its commitment to accurate and reliable developer resources, which is a central aspect of fostering an environment where developers can effectively use cloud-based AI services with confidence. As the AI landscape evolves, precise documentation ensures users can optimize and tailor solutions to their specific needs without the ambiguity of potential errors or misunderstandings.

}
```

### Explanation
In this code diff, a minor update has been made to the documentation file `search-get-started-vector.md`. The update involves modifying the description of the dimensions attribute for vector fields. Previously, the text stated that the dimensions attribute has a maximum of 3,072 floating point values. This has been corrected to indicate that the maximum is `4096` floating point values. This change is important for users who rely on accurate specifications regarding the maximum dimension sizes that can be utilized when working with vector fields in the Azure OpenAI service.

### Explanation
The code diff reflects a minor update to the documentation file `search-limits-quotas-capacity.md`. This update corrects the specified maximum dimensions for vector fields within the limits table. The maximum values previously reported as 4098 have been adjusted to the correct maximum of 4096 for all instances in the table across different service tiers. Ensuring the accuracy of this information is essential for users to understand the limitations when defining vector fields in their applications effectively.
