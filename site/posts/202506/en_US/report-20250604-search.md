# Highlights
The diff focuses on a series of minor updates across various documentation files within Azure AI's agentic retrieval and related guides. The modifications primarily include updating hyperlinks to direct users to a version of the Azure AI Foundry portal that potentially offers enriched documentation or contextual support. Additionally, there are corrections to terminology for consistency. These changes improve user navigation and ensure clarity and precision throughout the documentation.

## New features
- Updated hyperlinks in multiple documentation files to include query parameters (`?cid=learnDocs`), directing users to enhanced sections of the Azure AI Foundry portal.
  
## Breaking changes
- None reported. All changes are backward-compatible and aim to improve user navigation and documentation clarity.

## Other updates
- Terminology correction: Changed "requestor" to "requester" in certain documentation files to ensure linguistic precision.

# Insights
The series of updates presented in the diff underscore the importance of maintaining accurate and user-friendly documentation. Azure AI's documentation needs to serve as a reliable guide for users engaging with complex services like agentic retrieval, integrated vectorization, and network security settings. By updating the URLs, Azure AI aims to take users directly to parts of the portal that might offer additional or contextual documentation relevant to their search or model deployment tasks. This proactive approach ensures users are not just given instructions but are also directed to rich resources that might enhance their understanding and expedite their task execution.

Furthermore, attention to detail is reflected in correcting the terminology from "requestor" to "requester," showing the commitment to linguistic precision and professionalism in technical writing. Each modification involves a simple single-line addition and deletion, reflecting a sophisticated yet straightforward strategy of keeping documentation current and precise without overhauling the content structure. 

Overall, these updates, although minor, cumulatively enhance the quality of the documentation by aiming to deliver a seamless, informed, and supportive user experience. This ensures that the Azure AI documentation remains an authoritative resource that effectively supports users in maximizing Azure services and features.

+Per-user access over search results (sometimes referred to as *row-level security* or *document-level security*) isn't supported through role assignments. As a workaround, [create security filters](search-security-trimming-for-azure-search.md) that trim results by user identity, removing documents for which the requester shouldn't have access. See this [Enterprise chat sample using RAG](/azure/developer/python/get-started-app-chat-template) for a demonstration.
 
 Role assignments are cumulative and pervasive across all tools and client libraries. You can assign roles using any of the [supported approaches](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps) described in Azure role-based access control documentation.

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Clarify wording in RBAC documentation"
}
```

### Explanation
The code diff indicates a minor update to the `search-security-rbac.md` file, which discusses role-based access control (RBAC) within Azure AI Search. The change focuses on correcting a term from "requestor" to "requester." This adjustment enhances the clarity and accuracy of the terminology used in describing the handling of per-user access over search results, which is sometimes referred to as row-level or document-level security.

This revision consists of one addition and one deletion, resulting in two changes throughout the document. In addition to improving linguistic precision, the documentation continues to provide guidance on creating security filters to manage access to search results based on user identity. Overall, this update helps ensure that the guidance is clearly understood by users who are implementing security measures in Azure AI Search.
