 # Quickstart: Search for multimodal content in the Azure portal
 
-In this quickstart, you use the **Import and vectorize data** wizard in the Azure portal to get started with [multimodal search](multimodal-search-overview.md). The wizard simplifies the process of extracting page text and inline images from documents, describing images in natural language, vectorizing image descriptions and text, and storing images for later retrieval.
+In this quickstart, you use the **Import and vectorize data** wizard in the Azure portal to get started with [multimodal search](multimodal-search-overview.md). The wizard simplifies the process of extracting, chunking, vectorizing, and loading both text and images into a searchable index.
 
-The sample data consists of a multimodal PDF in the [azure-search-sample-data](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-sample-data/tree/main/sustainable-ai-pdf) repo, but you can use different files and still follow this quickstart.
+Unlike [Quickstart: Vector search in the Azure portal](search-get-started-portal-import-vectors.md), which processes simple text-containing images, this quickstart supports advanced image processing for multimodal RAG scenarios.
+
+This quickstart uses a multimodal PDF from the [azure-search-sample-data](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-sample-data/tree/main/sustainable-ai-pdf) repo. However, you can use different files and still complete this quickstart.

+### Supported extraction methods
+
+For content extraction, you can choose either default extraction via Azure AI Search or enhanced extraction via [Azure AI Document Intelligence](/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/overview). The following table describes both extraction methods.
+
+| Method | Description |
+|--|--|
+| Default extraction | Extracts location metadata from PDF images only. Doesn't require another Azure AI resource. |
+| Enhanced extraction | Extracts location metadata from text and images for multiple document types. Requires an [Azure AI services multi-service resource](/azure/ai-services/multi-service-resource#azure-ai-multi-services-resource-for-azure-ai-search-skills) <sup>1</sup> in a [supported region](cognitive-search-skill-document-intelligence-layout.md#supported--regions). |

Unless you use a [keyless connection](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md#bill-through-a-keyless-connection) to create the skillset, both resources must be in the same region.
+
+### Supported embedding methods
+
+For content embedding, you can choose either image verbalization (followed by text vectorization) or multimodal embeddings. Deployment instructions for the models are provided in a [later section](#deploy-models). The following table describes both embedding methods.

+
+<sup>2</sup> Azure OpenAI resources (with access to embedding models) that were created in the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) aren't supported. You must create an Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal.
+
+<sup>3</sup> For billing purposes, you must [attach your multi-service resource](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md) to the skillset in your Azure AI Search service. Unless you use a [keyless connection (preview)](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md#bill-through-a-keyless-connection) to create the skillset, both resources must be in the same region.
