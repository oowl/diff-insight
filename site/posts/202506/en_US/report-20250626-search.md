# Insights
The recent updates to the Azure Cognitive Search documentation are focused on enhancing clarity and usability for users navigating complex cognitive search scenarios. 

For developers working with Azure SQL indexers, a critical addition is the detailed documentation on handling the `Error: Failed to compare value 'X' of type M to value 'Y' of type N`. This error handling section provides an essential resource for troubleshooting common issues related to type mismatches during data change detection. The guidance to reset and rerun the indexer suggests practical steps for maintaining data integrity, which can often be a complex task in dynamic database environments.

Refinements to the C# quickstart guide offer enhanced readability and a more structured presentation of installation steps and code instructions. This is particularly beneficial for developers who rely on stringent coding practices to integrate Azure Cognitive Search capabilities effectively. By streamlining the code presentation and enhancing comment clarity, the guide serves as a more reliable resource for implementing these services in C# applications. The minor correction in quickstart references furthermore ensures that users are accessing the appropriate language-specific resources, thereby minimizing potential confusion.

The correction of typographical errors, although minor, signifies a commitment to precision and professionalism in documentation. Accurate language and precise instructions help establish trust and reliability, crucial components when guiding users through complex technical implementations. Overall, these documentation updates are designed to provide a more cohesive and error-free user experience, highlighting an ongoing dedication to support users with accurate and user-friendly resources in the Azure ecosystem.

+## `Error: Failed to compare value 'X' of type M to value 'Y' of type N.`
+
+This error usually happens in Azure SQL indexers when the source column type used for [`dataChangeDetectionPolicy`](search-how-to-index-sql-database.md#high-water-mark-change-detection-policy) doesnâ€™t match what the indexer expects, especially if [`convertHighWaterMarkToRowVersion`](search-how-to-index-sql-database.md#converthighwatermarktorowversion) is turned on.
+
+For example, if the column used for change detection is of type datetime, but the indexer expects a rowversion type because convertHighWaterMarkToRowVersion is enabled, the mismatch will cause an error.
+
+Check the data type for the 'High Water Mark' column in the source and update the indexer configuration accordingly. Once verified and updated, reset and rerun the indexer to process the column values.

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Add New Error Handling Information to Cognitive Search Documentation"
}
```

### Explanation
The recent changes made to the document `cognitive-search-common-errors-warnings.md` involve the addition of new error handling information. Specifically, a new section has been added to explain an error that occurs when there is a type mismatch between the source column type and the expected column type during data change detection in Azure SQL indexers. 

This addition provides users with a clearer understanding of the `Error: Failed to compare value 'X' of type M to value 'Y' of type N` error. It details the circumstances under which this error typically arises, specifically highlighting the implications of enabling the `convertHighWaterMarkToRowVersion`. The guidance includes instructions on verifying data types and updating the indexer configuration when necessary, ultimately advising users to reset and rerun the indexer to manage their column values appropriately. This enhancement improves the overall utility of the documentation by addressing common pitfalls encountered in cognitive search scenarios with Azure services.

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Refinements to C# Quickstart for Agentic Retrieval"
}
```

### Explanation
The recent modifications made to the `agentic-retrieval-csharp.md` document primarily involve significant content refinement throughout the C# quickstart guide. The changes included 79 additions and 71 deletions, resulting in a net change of 150 lines. 

Key updates include corrections and clarifications in the installation instructions for the Azure OpenAI client library, ensuring that the proper references are provided. The structure of the code has been improved for better readability by adding or modifying whitespace and indentation, making it easier for users to follow the coding practices.

The code comments have also been enhanced, providing clearer instructions regarding the creation of the index client and the handling of exceptions. Furthermore, the section pertaining to the vectorizer's parameters now presents the field definitions more cleanly, employing a more readable format. 

Additionally, the flow of the chat messages and the process for handling responses from both the Knowledge Agent and the OpenAI client have been slightly modified for clarity. This includes updates in the structure of how messages are added, making the code easier to understand and maintain. 

Overall, these refinements contribute to a more user-friendly and thorough experience for developers utilizing the Azure Cognitive Search capabilities within their C# applications.

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Correction of Typographical Error in App Portal Creation Instructions"
}
```

### Explanation
The latest modification to the document `search-create-app-portal.md` addresses a minor typographical error in the instructions for creating an application portal. Specifically, the word "publically" has been corrected to "publicly."

This change appears in the context of providing guidance on how to utilize a field for a thumbnail image when no images are available in the index. The instruction clarifies that if an index field has URLs to public images, that field should be configured for the thumbnail area. If image URLs are absent, the field should be left blank. 

Overall, this update enhances the clarity and accuracy of the documentation, ensuring that users have the correct information when setting up their search application portal.

### Explanation
The recent modification in the document `search-get-started-agentic-retrieval.md` involves a minor but important correction in the quickstart reference. The line referencing the Quickstart has been changed from "[!INCLUDE [Python quickstart](includes/quickstarts/agentic-retrieval-csharp.md)]" to "[!INCLUDE [C# quickstart](includes/quickstarts/agentic-retrieval-csharp.md)]".

This change correctly identifies the quickstart as being related to C#, aligning with the content provided in the included file. The adjustment enhances the clarity of the documentation by ensuring that users are directed to the appropriate resources for the C# programming language when embarking on agentic retrieval tasks.

Overall, this update supports a more informative and accurate user experience, preventing potential confusion regarding which programming language is being referred to in the context of the quickstart guide.
