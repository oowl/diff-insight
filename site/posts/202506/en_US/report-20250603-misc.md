# Insights
The diff highlights minor yet impactful updates focused on enhancing the clarity and usability of Azure AI service documentation. The update on model expiration dates enhances user comprehension regarding the lifecycle management of models within the Document Intelligence service. Specifically, it provides clarity on model expiration for APIs released in GA and the extended conditions for models developed using previous versions.

The reorganization in entity categories documentation clarifies which API versions are in preview and GA, aiding developers programming for compliance and performance consistency. By reflecting accurate API statuses, developers can make more informed decisions about the technology stack that best suits their applications.

Enhancing metadata across various quickstart guides not only improves documentation discoverability but underscores the commitment to maintain up-to-date resources for developers. Each entry now better clarifies ownership (with the authorship field) and currency (with the last modified date), which are essential for contributing to documentsâ€™ relevancy and credibility. Particularly, the addition of `build-2025` tags signifies alignment with current and upcoming product cycles.

Finally, the updates to the "What's New" documentation are critical for keeping users informed of the latest improvements and innovations within Azure AI Language. By articulating new features such as customizable PII detection and the deployment of Azure AI Language resources in new regions, the documentation caters to evolving user needs and expanding application scenarios, maintaining Azure's competitive edge in AI services. These updates consolidate key advances, ensuring that users can leverage the full potential of Azure's latest offerings and keep abreast of the latest developments.

 ## Models trained with GA API version
 
-With the v3.1 API, custom models introduce a new model expiration property. The model expiration is set to two years from the date the model is built for all requests that use a GA API to build a model. To continue to use the model past the expiration date, you need to  train the model with a current GA API version. The API version can be the one that the model was originally trained with or a later API version. The following figure illustrates the options when you need to retrain an expiring or expired model.

If the models were created earlier with no expiration date associated with them and were not retrained after v3.1/v4.0, the expiration date will be null. The models with expiration date property will still be available until the API retires. Notification of retirement of any particular GA API version will be communicated at least 3 years before expiration.

}
```

### Explanation
The recent update to the document located at `articles/ai-services/document-intelligence/train/custom-lifecycle.md` involves minor modifications aimed at enhancing clarity and providing additional information regarding model expiration properties for the v3.1 API of the Document Intelligence service. 

Notably, the date of the last modification was changed from November 19, 2024, to June 02, 2025, indicating ongoing updates to the content. Furthermore, the description of the model expiration process has been refined. The wording now clarifies that the model is configured to expire two years after its creation when built using a GA API and emphasizes the implications if the models were created prior to the v3.1/v4.0 releases.

Additionally, there is a new note detailing that models created before the introduction of expiration dates will not have an expiration date set unless they are retrained after the v3.1/v4.0 releases. This modification improves the understanding of how expiration dates are determined and communicates the API retirement notification protocol. 

Overall, these changes provide a clearer understanding of the model lifecycle in the context of the Document Intelligence service.

More skills follow.  
-* Runtime Container for Conversational Language Understanding (CLU) is available for on-premise connection.
-* Both our [Text PII redaction service](personally-identifiable-information/overview.md?tabs=text-pii) and our Conversational PII service preview API (version 2024-11-15-preview) now support the option to mask detected sensitive entities with a label beyond just redaction characters. Customers can specify if personal data content such as names and phone numbers, that is, "John Doe received a call from 424-878-9192", are masked with a redaction character, that is, "******** received a call from ************", or masked with an entity label, that is, "`PERSON_1` received a call from `PHONENUMBER_1`".

-* Language detection is a preconfigured feature that can detect the language a document is written in and returns a language code for a wide range of languages, variants, dialects, and some regional/cultural languages. Today the general availability of [scription detection capability](language-detection/how-to/call-api.md#script-name-and-script-code), and 16 more languages support, which adds up to [139 total supported languages](language-detection/language-support.md) is announced.
-* [Named Entity Recognition service](named-entity-recognition/overview.md), [Entity Resolution](named-entity-recognition/concepts/entity-resolutions.md) was upgraded to the Entity Metadata starting in API version 2023-04-15-preview. If you're calling the preview version of the API equal or newer than 2023-04-15-preview, check out the Entity Metadata article to use the resolution feature. The service now supports the ability to specify a list of entity tags to be included into the response or excluded from the response. If a piece of text is classified as more than one entity type, the overlapPolicy parameter allows customers to specify how the service will handle the overlap. The inferenceOptions parameter allows for users to adjust the inference, such as excluding the detected entity values from being normalized and included in the metadata. Along with these optional input parameters  we support an updated output structure (with new fields tags, type, and metadata) to ensure enhanced user customization and deeper analysis Learn more on our documentation.
-* Text analytics for health (TA4H) is a preconfigured feature that extracts and labels relevant medical information from unstructured texts such as doctor's notes, discharge summaries, clinical documents, and electronic health records. Today, we released support for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) structuring and temporal [assertion detection](text-analytics-for-health/concepts/assertion-detection.md) in the Generally Available API.
