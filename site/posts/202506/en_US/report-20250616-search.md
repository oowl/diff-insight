 Suburban belts often exhibit larger December brightening than urban cores primarily because of the type of development and light distribution in those areas. Suburbs tend to have more uniform and expansive lighting, making them more visible in nighttime satellite images. In contrast, urban cores, although having higher absolute light levels, often contain dense building clusters that can cause light to be obscured or concentrated in smaller areas, leading to less visible brightening when viewed from space.  Regarding the visibility of the Phoenix nighttime street grid from space, it is attributed to the city's grid layout and the intensity of its street lighting. The grid pattern of the streets and the significant development around them create a stark contrast against less developed areas. Conversely, large stretches of interstate in the Midwest may remain dimmer due to fewer densely populated structures and less intensive street lighting, resulting in less illumination overall.

+## Configure role-based access
+
+You can use search service API keys or Microsoft Entra ID with role assignments. Keys are easier to start with, but roles are more secure. This quickstart assumes roles.
+
+To configure the recommended role-based access:
+
+1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
+
+1. [Enable role-based access](../../search-security-enable-roles.md) on your Azure AI Search service.
+
+1. On your Azure AI Search service, [assign the following roles](../../search-security-rbac.md#how-to-assign-roles-in-the-azure-portal) to yourself.
+
+    + **Search Service Contributor**
+
+    + **Search Index Data Contributor**
+
+    + **Search Index Data Reader**
+
+For agentic retrieval, Azure AI Search also needs access to your Azure OpenAI Foundry resource. 
+
+1. [Create a system-assigned managed identity](../../search-howto-managed-identities-data-sources.md#create-a-system-managed-identity) on your Azure AI Search service. Here's how to do it using the Azure CLI:
+
+   ```azurecli
+   az search service update --name YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME --resource-group YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME --identity-type SystemAssigned
+   ```
+   
+    If you already have a managed identity, you can skip this step.
+
+1. On your Azure AI Foundry resource, assign **Cognitive Services User** to the managed identity that you created for your search service. 
+
+## Deploy models
+
+To use agentic retrieval, you must deploy [one of the supported Azure OpenAI models](../../search-agentic-retrieval-how-to-create.md#supported-models) to your Azure AI Foundry resource:
+
++ A chat model for query planning and answer generation. We use `gpt-4.1-mini` in this quickstart. Optionally, you can use a different model for query planning and another for answer generation, but this quickstart uses the same model for simplicity.
+
++ An embedding model for vector queries. We use `text-embedding-3-large` in this quickstart, but you can use any embedding model that supports the `text-embedding` task.
+
+To deploy the Azure OpenAI models:
+
+1. Sign in to the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) and select your Azure AI Foundry resource.
+
+1. From the left pane, select **Model catalog**.
+
+1. Select **gpt-4.1-mini**, and then select **Use this model**.
+
+1. Specify a deployment name. To simplify your code, we recommend **gpt-4.1-mini**.
+
+1. Leave the default settings.
+
+1. Select **Deploy**.
+
+1. Repeat the previous steps, but this time deploy the **text-embedding-3-large** embedding model.
+
+## Get endpoints
+
+In your code, you specify the following endpoints to establish connections with you Azure AI Search service and Azure AI Foundry resource. These steps assume that you [configured role-based access as described previously](#configure-role-based-access). 
+
+To obtain your service endpoints:
+
+1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
+
+1. On your Azure AI Search service:
+
+    1. From the left pane, select **Overview**.
+
+    1. Copy the URL, which should be similar to `https://my-service.search.windows.net`. 
+
+1. On your Azure AI Foundry resource:
+
+    1. From the left pane, select **Resource Management** > **Keys and Endpoint**. 
+
+    1. Select the **OpenAI** tab and copy the URL that looks similar to `https://my-resource.openai.azure.com`.
