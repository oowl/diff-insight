# Insights
The latest documentation updates for Azure AI and OpenAI bring several key changes, emphasizing the dynamic nature of these technologies and the necessity for users to stay informed. 

The most critical update involves the breaking change to the documentation concerning deprecated and retired models within Azure OpenAI. This change reflects a broader organizational effort to clarify the status of modelsâ€”now explicitly listing retired models, deprecation and retirement dates, and suggested replacements. With 121 lines removed and 48 added, the streamlined document offers users enhanced clarity and precision, significantly impacting those relying on Azure OpenAI for application development. Adapting to these changes will require users to monitor the availability of models closely and potentially adjust their models and strategies accordingly.

The introduction of a new document on model retirements serves as a significant enhancement to the existing documentation. It provides a 112-line comprehensive guide outlining retirement policies, schedules, and automatic upgrade processes applicable during scheduled windows. Users benefit from clear details on versions, retirement dates, and replacement models, empowering them to anticipate and manage changes proactively. The explanation of a dual-phase retirement process for fine-tuned models, linked to their base models, prepares users for possible functionality losses, aiding in effective planning.

Minor updates, while not significantly altering user behaviors, aim to improve clarity and accessibility of the documentation, ensuring more users successfully navigate features without misunderstanding. These include the global eligibility for the asynchronous filter, where previously, eligibility required special approval. Adjustments in how content filtering applies to API requests similarly target better guidance, while changes to regional availability of fine-tune models reflect Azure's expanding global footprint, letting users optimize their setup based on regional availability.

Overall, these document modifications are indicative of Azure's commitment to clear communication, better user experience, and keeping their user base informed of the evolving nature of AI technologies, ensuring users make well-informed, strategic decisions moving forward.

    "modification_title": "Update on Eligibility and Configuration for Asynchronous Filter"
}
```

### Explanation
The modification involves minor updates to the documentation regarding the Asynchronous Filter in the Azure AI Foundry portal. Specifically, it clarifies that the eligibility for this filter has changed from being limited to "Customers approved for modified content filtering" to "All customers." Additionally, the instructions on how to enable the asynchronous filter have been slightly rephrased to indicate that all customers can configure this directly in the Azure AI Foundry portal as part of the content filtering configuration applied at the deployment level. The overall structure of the table in the document has also been updated to reflect these changes. This ensures that all customers are aware of their ability to use the feature without undergoing special approval.

-# Azure OpenAI in Azure AI Foundry Models deprecated models
-
-Azure OpenAI offers a variety of models for different use cases. The following models were deprecated on July 6, 2023 and will be retired on June 14, 2024.  These models are no longer available for new deployments. Deployments created prior to July 6, 2023 remain available to customers until June 14, 2024. We recommend customers migrate their applications to deployments of replacement models prior to the June 14, 2024 retirement.
-
-At the time of retirement, deployments of these models will stop returning valid API responses.
-
-## GPT-3.5
-
-The impacted GPT-3.5 models are the following. The replacement for the GPT-3.5 models is GPT-3.5 Turbo Instruct when that model becomes available.
-
-- `text-davinci-002`
-- `text-davinci-003`
-- `code-davinci-002`
-
-## GPT-3 
-
-The impacted GPT-3 models are the following. The replacement for the GPT-3 models is GPT-3.5 Turbo Instruct when that model becomes available.
-
-- `text-ada-001`
-- `text-babbage-001`
-- `text-curie-001`
-- `text-davinci-001`
-- `code-cushman-001`
-
-## Embedding models
-
-The embedding models below will be retired effective June 14, 2024. Customers should migrate to `text-embedding-ada-002` (version 2).

-We'll notify all customers with these preview deployments at least 30 days before the start of the upgrades. We'll publish an upgrade schedule detailing the order of regions and model versions that we'll follow during the upgrades, and link to that schedule from here.
-
-> [!TIP]
-> **Will a model upgrade happen if the new model version is not yet available in that region?**
->
-> Yes, even in cases where the latest model version is not yet available in a region, we'll automatically upgrade deployments during the scheduled upgrade window. For more information, see [Azure OpenAI model versions](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/model-versions#will-a-model-upgrade-happen-if-the-new-model-version-is-not-yet-available-in-that-region).
-
-> [!IMPORTANT]
-> Vision enhancements preview features including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), object grounding, video prompts will be retired and no longer available once `gpt-4` Version: `vision-preview` is upgraded to `turbo-2024-04-09`. If you're currently relying on any of these preview features, this automatic model upgrade will be a breaking change.

-## Fine-tuned models
-
-Fine-tuned models retire in two phases: training and deployment.
-
-All fine-tuned models follow their equivalent base model for **training** retirement. Once retired, a given model is no longer available for fine tuning.
-
-For fine-tuned models made generally available since `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`, **deployment** retirement occurs 1 year after **training** retirement. At deployment retirement, inference and deployment returns error responses.

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Refinements to Model Retirement Notifications and Current Models"
}
```

### Explanation
This modification to the document on model retirements in Azure OpenAI includes several key updates aimed at improving the clarity and organization of the information provided. Notably, the procedures for notifying customers about upcoming model retirements have been refined, specifying the timescales for retirement dates for both preview models (90-120 days) and Generally Available (GA) models (365 days). 

In addition, a section has been added highlighting the current models available for use, accompanied by a note indicating that not all models go through a deprecation period before retirement. Large portions of the old content were removed to streamline the document and reduce redundancy, totaling a deletion of 254 lines, while 19 new lines were added for enhanced clarity. 

Moreover, the customer notification processes have been clarified to include both Azure Resource Health alerts and email notifications to subscription owners, allowing for better tracking of upcoming changes. Overall, these refinements contribute to a clearer, more user-friendly document that presents essential information regarding model retirements and current model options in Azure OpenAI.

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "minor update",
    "modification_title": "Updates to Content Filtering Documentation"
}
```

### Explanation
The modifications made to the content filters documentation for Azure OpenAI include minor textual changes and the addition of an important note regarding the usage of content filter specifications during API requests. 

Firstly, a precision in wording has been implemented by changing "for every API call" to "for each API call," clarifying the statement without altering the original meaning. Additional content has been introduced, specifically a warning that content filter specifications at request time are not applicable for image input scenarios, directing users to use the default content filter instead in those cases. 

The overall update enhances the documentation by providing clearer instructions and important caveats, which helps users understand the limitations of content filtering when working with images. The changes, while minor in scale â€” with an addition of 7 lines and a deletion of just 2 â€” contribute significantly to the clarity and practicality of the guidance provided for content filtering configurations.

+
+We notify all customers with these preview deployments at least 30 days before the start of the upgrades. We publish an upgrade schedule detailing the order of regions and model versions that we follow during the upgrades, and link to that schedule from here.
+
+> [!TIP]
+> **Will a model upgrade happen if the new model version is not yet available in that region?**
+>
+> Yes, even in cases where the latest model version is not yet available in a region, we automatically upgrade deployments during the scheduled upgrade window. For more information, see [Azure OpenAI model versions](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/model-versions#will-a-model-upgrade-happen-if-the-new-model-version-is-not-yet-available-in-that-region).
+
+## Fine-tuned models
+
+Fine-tuned models retire in two phases: training and deployment.
+
+All fine-tuned models follow their equivalent base model for **training** retirement. Once retired, a given model is no longer available for fine tuning.
+
+For fine-tuned models made generally available since `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`, **deployment** retirement occurs 1 year after **training** retirement. At deployment retirement, inference and deployment returns error responses.

### Summary

```json
{
    "modification_type": "new feature",
    "modification_title": "Addition of Model Retirement Documentation"
}
```

### Explanation
A new document has been added to the Azure OpenAI documentation, specifically detailing the retirement schedule and policies for various models. This comprehensive addition spans 112 lines and includes structured tables that outline the retirement dates and replacement models for text generation, audio, image and video, and embedding models.

The document systematically categorizes models into different sections, each providing essential information on their respective versions, retirement dates, and any proposed replacements. It highlights significant details, such as the automatic upgrade process for deployment during scheduled windows, ensuring that users are informed well ahead of any model upgrades and outlining the procedures followed for notification.

Furthermore, the section on fine-tuned models clarifies the dual-phase retirement process, explaining how it is tied to the retirement of their base models. This sets clear expectations for users regarding when they might lose access to certain functionalities.

In summary, this addition enhances the overall clarity and usability of the Azure OpenAI documentation, providing users with vital insights into model lifecycle management and ensuring they are well-prepared for future changes.
