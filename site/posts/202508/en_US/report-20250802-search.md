 An upgrade brings older search services to the capabilities of new services created in the same region. Specifically, it upgrades the computing power of the underlying service. This one-time operation doesn't introduce breaking changes to your application, and you shouldn't need to change any code.
 
 For [eligible services](#upgrade-eligibility), an upgrade increases the [partition storage](#higher-storage-limits) and [vector index size](#higher-vector-limits) on the same tier at no extra cost.

 In April 2024, Azure AI Search increased the [storage capacity](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#service-limits) of newly created search services. Services created before April 2024 saw no capacity changes, so if you wanted larger and faster partitions, you had to create a new service. However, some older services can now be upgraded to benefit from the higher-capacity partitions.
 
-In this preview, an upgrade only increases the [storage limit](#higher-storage-limits) and [vector index size](#higher-vector-limits) of [eligible services](#upgrade-eligibility).

 You can use Microsoft Entra ID and role assignments for outbound connections from Azure AI Search to resources providing data, applied AI, or vectorization during indexing or queries.
 
 To use roles on an outbound connection, first configure your search service to use either a [system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) as the security principal for your search service in a Microsoft Entra tenant. Once you have a managed identity, you can assign roles for authorized access.

 ## Index size and schema
 
-Queries run faster on smaller indexes. This is partly a function of having fewer fields to scan, but it's also due to how the system caches content for future queries. After the first query, some content remains in memory where it's searched more efficiently. Because index size tends to grow over time, one best practice is to periodically revisit index composition, both schema and documents, to look for content reduction opportunities. However, if the index is right-sized, the only other calibration you can make is to increase capacity by [upgrading your service](search-how-to-upgrade.md), [adding replicas](search-capacity-planning.md#add-or-remove-partitions-and-replicas), or [switching to a higher tier](search-capacity-planning.md#change-your-pricing-tier). The section "[Tip: Switch to a Standard S2 tier](#tip-switch-to-a-standard-s2-tier)" discusses the scale up versus scale out decision.

 The Standard S1 search tier is often where customers start. A common pattern for S1 services is that indexes grow over time, which requires more partitions. More partitions lead to slower response times, so more replicas are added to handle the query load. As you can imagine, the cost of running an S1 service has now progressed to levels beyond the initial configuration.
